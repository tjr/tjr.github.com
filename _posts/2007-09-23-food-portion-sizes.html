<p>
I offered to pick up some "Chinese food" for some colleagues visiting the United States from China. They didn't recognize anything on the menu, and ended up ordering the "house special", with grilled chicken, vegetables, and rice. Reasonably healthy, from the looks of it. About an hour after getting our food, I noticed that they had not finished eating what they ordered, and I asked if it was all right.
<p>
"This is too much food for us; we can't eat it all!" they explained.
<p>
"It's too much for us too," I assured them, "but we eat it all anyway."
