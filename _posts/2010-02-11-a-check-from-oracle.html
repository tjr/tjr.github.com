Today I received in the mail a check for $190 from <a href="http://www.oracle.com/">Oracle Corporation</a>.
<p>
I graduated from high school in the summer of 1998. As a graduation gift, my grandfather gave me $500 to invest in the stock market, in hopes that I would learn something about business and stocks. I had spent the past year becoming very seriously interested in computer programming, and the hip new programming system at the time was <a href="http://java.sun.com/">Java</a>, produced by <a href="http://www.sun.com/">Sun Microsystems</a>. So, without knowing much about the stock market, or even about the financials of Sun Microsystems, I decided to put the whole $500 into Sun stock, on the basis of liking their products. I was able to buy ten shares.
<p>
I asked for the stock certificate to be mailed to me personally, and, like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQeOVrnma8I">Balki Bartokomous on Perfect Strangers</a>, I framed the stock certificate and hung it on the wall. I was not particularly interested in making money through the stock, but rather, was delighted to be a part-owner of my favorite company.
<p>
About six months later, in December of 1998, my grandfather very unexpectedly passed away. I knew he had not been feeling well, but he was generally a very healthy person. There is much I could write about how my life changed after this (in short, I became much more aware of spending time on things that are long-term important), but the relevancy to the present story is that I suddenly no longer saw my stock as just a symbol of company ownership; it was now the last gift that my grandfather gave to me.
<p>
A few weeks later, I happened to be browsing a newspaper, and looked up in the financial section the current value of Sun stock. To my surprise, it had doubled since I bought it, and my ten shares were now worth $1000. Months went by, and Sun Microsystems, a major provider of networking hardware during the dotCom boom, continued doing very well. They went through several stock splits: my ten shares turned into twenty, then forty, then eighty. Eventually, my $500 investment was worth around $6000.
<p>
I imagine that if my grandfather had still be around, he would have advised me to sell the stock. But I continued to view it more as a cherished gift than as a way to make money, and held onto the stock.
<p>
Years passed, and the dotCom boom morphed into the dotCom bust. The value of the stock sank and sank and sank, eventually getting down to around the same price that I originally paid for it.
<p>
In 2008, I received a letter from Sun, stating that they were initiating a reverse stock split, and I was advised to send my shares back to them, in exchange for a smaller number of shares at the same value. I complied, but rather than getting another certificate, I received a notice that I would not be getting a paper certificate, but electronic-only shares. It was disappointing to lose my physical stock document, but I still owned the stock itself.
<p>
In 2009, I learned that Sun was being bought by Oracle Corporation. Another disappointment. Oracle may be a great company, but there would surely be changes; some product lines may continue on, but the company that I thought was so neat in 1998 was coming to an end.
<p>
Not reading much of the details of the transaction, I assumed that I would get stock in Oracle now, but this wasn't the case. Instead, I received a check from Oracle, with a note explaining that Sun stockholders were being given $9.50 per share of Sun.
<p>
So now I have $190, which, in some sense, is what remains of my grandfather's gift. He wanted me to learn about business, and about investing, and about the stock market. I like to think I've learned a lot about these topics over the past twelve years, though you couldn't tell it by looking at my $190 check. I held on to that stock despite common sense, because I valued it more sentimentally. I suppose there is nothing wrong with doing that, if that's what you want to do, though I now realize that it wasn't the stock itself that I cherished, but rather memories of my grandfather.
