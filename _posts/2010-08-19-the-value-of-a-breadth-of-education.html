title: The Value of a Breadth of Education
layout: post
---
<p>As a college student, I selected computer science as my major course of study, as it seemed most useful to my post-graduation professional plans. But I did then and do now greatly enjoy studying computer science on my own; I don’t need the structure and motivation provided by a formal classroom setting in order to persuade myself to learn more about software engineering and algorithms.</p>

<p>So of what value is a college education to someone who is motivated to learn on their own? Everyone is different, but in retrospect, I for one greatly appreciate the breadth of study required by the college curriculum.</p>

<p>I not only enjoy studying computer science on my own; I also enjoy studying a variety of other topics. But I tend to hyper-focus on often very specific topics and study them in-depth. I might, for example, study United States history at the expense of ignoring all other history; more narrowly, I might study the period of the founding of the United States at the expense of ignoring all other periods of United States history.</p>

<p>This is not necessarily a bad trait; I reckon it’s better to be studious about a few particular topics than not at all. But in college I was required to take a certain number of classes that met particular criteria, and accordingly ended up studying topics that I had not previously considered: Russian history, early 20th century United States culture, jazz history, and geology, to name a few.</p>

<p>All of these topics are interesting, but not all are really my cup of tea. I might never study these topics to any significant way again, but my knowledge in these areas has been greatly expanded through the coursework. Even within jazz, which I do enjoy listening to, I found myself listening to periods and genre of jazz that I had previously ignored: I don’t particularly like listening to Jelly Roll Morton, but I have better appreciation for his contributions to jazz, and can listen to his recordings with more understanding of what he was doing at the time.</p>

<p>Will any of this knowledge help me to get a better job? Probably not. My major studies of computer science — those things I likely would have learned anyway — were the part of my college education that helped me get work. But all of the other things I learned helped to make life more interesting, and I feel better about myself for having learned them.</p>
