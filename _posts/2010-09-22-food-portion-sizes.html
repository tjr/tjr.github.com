title: Food Portion Sizes

<p>I offered to pick up some &#8220;Chinese food&#8221; for some colleagues visiting the United States from China. They didn&#8217;t recognize anything on the menu, and ended up ordering the &#8220;house special&#8221;, with grilled chicken, vegetables, and rice. Reasonably healthy, from the looks of it. About an hour after getting our food, I noticed that they had not finished eating what they ordered, and I asked if it was all right.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is too much food for us; we can&#8217;t eat it all!&#8221; they explained.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too much for us too,&#8221; I assured them, &#8220;but we eat it all anyway.&#8221;</p>
