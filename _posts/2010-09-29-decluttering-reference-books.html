title: Decluttering Reference Books
---

I enjoy reading. I enjoy books, and journals, and bookstores, and libraries. Recently I've been feeling that my personal book collection is becoming cluttered: many books acquired that I no longer have interest in, and insufficient space in which to put books that I am interested in. What can you do with books that you no longer wish to hold on to?
<p>
Some books may have a reasonable resale value, and could be sold either online or locally. Other books quickly depreciate in value, and it seems that my own book clutter consists mainly of this latter sort: old reference materials, descriptions of specific obsolete technologies, etc. Books that not only do I no longer have use for, but that nobody living in the same time continuum with me would have any use for either. Perhaps I could take these books to a used bookstore, or to a library, or to some other donations center, but they are effectively worthless.
<p>
The Berkeley Heights Public Library <a href="http://bhplnjbookgroup.blogspot.com/2007/02/disposing-of-old-books.html">addresses this concept</a>, concluding that "essentially, if you don't recycle your old books that are unusable, unsalable, unwanted, obsolete; you are passing on the job to someone else who will recycle them."
<p>
Even if I am presently stuck with a pile of obsolete books that I can't do anything useful with, it makes me consider my future book purchase plans: is there anything that I can do to reduce future book clutter?

The world wide web is rightly viewed as a great source of information, but it's not a great source of all information. If you wish to study topics in-depth, web searches often turn up lacking, and you really still need to use books. Fortunately though, the web is outstanding as a source of encyclopedia-style reference material, making it a fine replacement for the sorts of books that easily become obsolete.
<p>
To wit, while a couple of decades ago buying things like encyclopedias in physical book form made good sense, it really isn't useful any more. Before buying a new book, it would be good to consider if the contents of the book is something that is readily available via the web or not. Sometimes, even content available via the web is more easily consumed in book form, but if the content is so available, we should very carefully consider how much we need a printed & bound copy before spending money and taking up shelf space.
