title: PowerOn Computer Recycling

<p><div>

I recently decided it was time for a computer upgrade. What, though, to do with the old computer? I had two, actually: a laptop and a desktop system, to be replaced with a single better laptop and an external display.

I usually turn to eBay for selling used technology, but while perusing the <a href="http://store.apple.com/">online Apple store</a> for new equipment, I noticed an offer for <a href="http://reuse.poweron.com/">recycling your old computer equipment</a>, handled by a company called <a href="http://www.poweron.com/">PowerOn</a>. It appeared that by going this route I might get a few dozen dollars less than I would if I sold to someone on eBay, but I really liked the notion of the old computer being professionally serviced and prepared for resale.

All I had to do to get things started was fill in information about the computers and estimate their condition based on a few criteria. A couple of simple web forms and about a week later, I had two prepaid shipping boxes delivered to my house, into which I carefully placed my old computers (both with totally erased hard drives), and dropped them off at a nearby FedEx pickup location. I had forgotten just how heavy that G5 PowerMac was&#8230;

About a week after this, I received email notification that my computers had been inspected by PowerOn staff, and deemed to be in worse condition than I had estimated in the web forms, and accordingly were offering me a little less money than estimated originally on the web forms. No big deal; assuming their evaluations were correct, I could now not sell the machines myself in good conscious without repairing them, which I really didn&#8217;t want to bother doing, so it still made sense to me to let PowerOn handle refurbishing and reselling the computers.

All in all, I found it to be a good experience. If your goal is maximum financial return on your computer hardware, this probably isn&#8217;t the best option for you, but if you&#8217;re willing to accept a little less money in exchange for letting someone else handle the details of resale (and if you&#8217;re willing to accept your money in the form of Apple store gift cards) then PowerOn recycling may be a great choice.

(Some computers are so utterly ancient and worthless on the resale market, such as laptops from 2005, that PowerOn might not be able to offer you any money whatsoever, but they can still properly recycle your computer, which would be a better option than letting it slowly decay in a trash dump.)
