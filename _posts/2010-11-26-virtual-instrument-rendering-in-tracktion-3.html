title: Virtual Instrument Rendering in Tracktion 3
layout: post
---
<p>
I've noticed that when using a virtual instrument in Tracktion 3,
sometimes the rendered track doesn&#8217;t play back smoothly&#8230;
popping noises, sustained notes cutting off, etcetera. Upgrading to a
newer computer solved a lot of these issues, and for the remaining
issues, the seemingly illogical process of &#8220;well, render it
again and see if it sounds better next time&#8221; usually gave good
enough results.
<p>
Yesterday I got the Native
Instruments <a href="http://www.native-instruments.com/#/en/products/producer/powered-by-kontakt/abbey-road-60s-drums/">Abbey
Road 60&#8217;s drums virtual instrument</a>, and my first few
attempts at rendering the MIDI track to audio were utterly
miserable. I had read that the root problem was that the rendering
takes place so fast that the computer can&#8217;t load the samples
from the hard drive fast enough to keep up, and that one solution
would be to render the audio track in real time (that is, at 1x
speed).
<p>
Tracktion, though doesn&#8217;t have an option to render individual
audio tracks at 1x speed. One way you can get around this is to solo
the MIDI track that you want to render, and then export the entire
project at 1x speed, and then import the exported wave file.Â  I tried
this with an Abbey Road drums track, and it works great.
<p>
Unfortunately for us Tracktion fans, there seems to
be <a href="http://www.kvraudio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=285173&amp;sid=49fc8edf69d5804b375be7cfe1d67451">rumor
floating about</a> that Mackie&#8217;s future support of Tracktion
will be minimal, but that&#8217;s another issue&#8230; and possibly a
good enough reason to switch to the
new <a href="http://www.sweetwater.com/feature/pt9/">standalone
ProTools software</a>...
