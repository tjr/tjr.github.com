title: Racing Toward an Utter Lack of Privacy?
---

According to an <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704694004576020083703574602.html">article published by the Wall Street Journal</a>, it seems that an alarming number of smartphone applications may transmit various personal information about the phone user to the software developers or to advertising agencies...  information such as current location, name, gender, age, phone number, or unique phone serial number... all without the user consenting or even being aware of what is happening.

<p>
One possible response to this would be to toss out the smartphone and go back to a mobile phone that doesn't run custom user applications. This would certainly mitigate some risk of loss of privacy, but that doesn't make the risk go away. What's to stop the developers of any mobile phone software, including that which runs on the most basic of phones, from programming similar data collection routines? Or for that matter, what's to stop the developers of software that runs on desktop or laptop computers from doing the same thing?

<p>
Maybe you aren't concerned about privacy. "I've got nothing to hide!" is a common retort. That may well be true; I don't have anything to hide either. I maintain a personal web site <a href="/">modestly named after myself</a>, and have published various writings and music recordings in my name. I'm clearly not anonymous to the world, but that doesn't mean that I wish to have every aspect of my life, my interests, or my communications with others made a matter of public record. I make some things public, but also wish to maintain privacy where and when desired. And we should all be able to set our own threshold of privacy, whether if you wish to be completely anonymous in your online actions, or if you wish to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin.tv#Lifecasting_origins">publish every moment of your day</a>.

<p>
Software applications that secretly send information about me to third parties clearly pose a threat to my ability to maintain my own threshold of privacy. Is there anything that can be done?

<p>
Ultimately, as long as the software is proprietary, that means that nobody except for its developers can be sure of everything that it does. Much software today, including both mobile phone software and desktop computer software, is proprietary. We can never know for sure what it may be doing behind the scenes. Every document we save with a proprietary word processor could be quietly sent to someone else across the internet. Our personal contacts list stored in a proprietary address book program could be quietly shared with third-party advertisement companies.

<p>
If we want to know for sure what the software that we run is doing, then one thing we can do is to choose to run <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a>: software that respects our freedom. Free software allows you to inspect the source code to see exactly what the software does. Free software allows you to change the software if you don't like what it does (or hire someone else to change it for you). If we truly wish to maintain complete control over our privacy in using computer systems, we must stop supporting proprietary software that has the potential to hide its actions from us.

<p>
It is possible to use computer systems running nothing but free software, though this can a big step for many computer users. A more graduated approach would be to start replacing individual proprietary applications that you use with free software, such as using <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/">Firefox</a> rather than Internet Explorer. Such substitutions will help to return to you the balance of setting your own privacy threshold, though even the underlying operating system, if proprietary, may prevent the balance from being completely on your side.
