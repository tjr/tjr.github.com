title: Selecting a Writing Implement
---

Several years ago, I conducted experiments toward finding the ideal ink pen to use for writing music charts. I am fond of the overall appearance of the jazz charts found in The Real Book, and so held that as a specific goal toward which to aim. Research on the internet suggested that the charts in The Real Book were written using an Osmiroid fountain pen with a music nib. Unfortunately, this particular pen was no longer manufactured. I tried some other fountain pens without finding much that I particularly liked.

I finally settled on using a PaperMate felt tip pen. It does not offer the subtle calligraphic edge found in traditional music notation, but it has an overall nice look, and it is very easy to write with. I found myself using this pen more and more often for everyday writing tasks beyond music: it required significantly less pressure to write with compared to many other pens that I had used, and thus was easier on the wrist. I used to just grab whatever pen was laying around nearby without putting much thought into it; I now rarely write with anything other than felt tip pens. It really makes a difference.

Perhaps you aren't fond of felt tip pens. That's quite all right; my intent here is not to convert everyone to using felt tip pens. But if you do a lot of writing by hand, be it words or music or drawings, you should consider making sure that your writing implement truly suits you well. I believe, purposefully trying out several options and making a conscious decision to use what works best for you can result in a more pleasant writing experience.
