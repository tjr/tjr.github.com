title: Will I Ever Use This In The Real World?

<p>This month saw the publication of Don Knuth&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201038048/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=trevrothswebl-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=0201038048">Art of Computer Programming Volume 4A</a>. In eager anticipation of receiving my copy in the mail, I was reading some of Knuth&#8217;s writings on number theory. This ostensibly had nothing to do with anything I was working on in the real world, but I was enjoying it.</p>

<p>Today I was trying to solve an odd programming problem for a project I&#8217;ve been consulting on. The program was supposed to receive a series of (X, Y) coordinate pairs and process them, but for some reason the processing of the Y coordinate was consistently off, while the processing of the X coordinate was perfect. Moreover, the larger the Y value, the worse the processed result became. I presume that something was going wrong in the processing, but exactly what was eluding me.</p>

<p>While I did not have this matter in mind at all during my reading of Knuth, I was inspired by some of the number theory concepts to find an approximate pattern in the faulty processing and then find an acceptable value to multiply our Y-coordinate by, such that the modified Y input would offset the problem. I still didn&#8217;t understand the underlying cause of the problem, but the software was supposed to ship today, and this made it work acceptably well.</p>

<p>My fix was not particularly an application of number theory; at most, it was basic algebra. But even though number theory itself wasn&#8217;t involved in my solution, studying number theory prepared my mind to think in the direction of seeking patterns in numbers, something that I probably wouldn&#8217;t have thought of otherwise.</p>

<p>So to the question, &#8220;will I ever use this in the real world?&#8221;, the answer may well be no&#8230; but even if not, the study of the material forms new connections in your thinking, which may help you in real world situations.</p>
