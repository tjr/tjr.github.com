title: Contemplating Digital Books
---

A while ago, I shared about decluttering my bookshelves. A friend asked me why I didn't
just <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002FQJT3Q/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=trevisrothwes-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=217145&#038;creative=399373&#038;creativeASIN=B002FQJT3Q">get a Kindle</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=&#038;l=as2&#038;o=1&#038;a=B002FQJT3Q&#038;camp=217145&#038;creative=399373" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. Fair question!

<p>
I've always enjoyed books: reading books, and being around books. I've been slow to warm up to the idea of replacing paper books with a digital reader, but over the past few months I've warmed up somewhat.

<p>
Since January I've read three novels as digital books on my iPhone. It was a surprisingly not unpleasant experience; I can only imagine that using a Kindle (or some other larger-screen digital book reader) would be even more not unpleasant.

<p>
I've also come to realize that, even amongst the books that I decided that I wanted to
keep rather than discard in my decluttering, many of them I rarely look at. IBM's guide

I've done some PowerPC development, and don't want to lose
the ability to look things up in this book, but honestly, it's been years since I've
looked at it. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0818689765/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=trevisrothwes-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=217145&#038;creative=399373&#038;creativeASIN=0818689765">X.25 and Related Protocols</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=&#038;l=as2&#038;o=1&#038;a=0818689765&#038;camp=217145&#038;creative=399373" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />? That was useful for a project I was working on
last year; I might never need it again, but I hesitate to get rid of it. A stack of miscellaneous

Enjoyable, and I'll probably read them again, but
it may be years until I do so.

<p>
All of these (and more) sound like excellent examples of something that I would like to have
as a digital book. So what would I want to keep on paper? Anything?

<p>
I think that I am not yet emotionally prepared to give up my favorite books in paper format,
even if they could be placed into the above category of something I rarely look at. Additionally,
some books are just typeset and printed and bound so nicely that I find it hard to imagine a
digital version being as satisfying to read. Knuth's

comes to mind, as does just about anything published by the <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/">MIT Press</a>.
(Perhaps the best way for paper books to continue to be relevant is not to become cheaper, but to become higher quality!)

<p>
That said, some additional barriers do stand in the way of my proposed transition to digital books. First, many of the books that I would consider keeping in digital format are not presently available in digital format. I could scan my printed copies myself, but that would take too much time for it to be worth the results. Next, even for the books that are available in digital format, in many cases, it costs nearly as much to buy the digital book as it does the printed book. If I already own the printed book, I am at a loss to justify buying the digital version. Last, and in some respects most significant, while many digital books are available as unrestrained PDF files, many others are available only with digital rights management in place, which could potentially lead to not being able to read the book in the future, and being forced to buy it yet again.

<p>
Considering all of that, I think I'll keep my printed books for the time being, though, when reasonable, building a collection of digital books may also be a good idea.
