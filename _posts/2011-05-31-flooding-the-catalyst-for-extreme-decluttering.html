title: Flooding - the Catalyst for Extreme Decluttering
---

<p>
I may yet be persuaded toward favoring digital books. Last month I went downstairs into my home office area to discover that the carpet was very wet. Several deconstructive days later we came to discover a crack in the concrete wall (behind the drywall) which had allowed a good bit of water to leak into the basement. We also came to discover that the previous owners of the house who had finished the basement opted against installing a proper subfloor beneath the carpet, preferring to just put the carpet padding directly on the concrete floor.
<p>
The basement was, superficially, the most nicely-finished room the in the house. While we had plans for refinishing other areas, we were very happy with the basement. In the face of being forced to refinish it, I decided I would rather have a hardwood floor than carpeting. In order to accommodate a hardwood floor, and to mitigate water problems in the future, we also decided
to lay down a subfloor using <a href="http://www.dricore.com/">DriCore panels</a>.
<p>
A bunch of cardboard boxes were ruined from the water, but thankfully their contents were kept safe. These boxes have now been replaced with plastic storage bins. Several bookcases were growing mold, but most books appear to be unharmed. (One bookcase that escaped the mold met an untimely end when I stumbled on the stairs and fell into it…)
<p>
So what have we learned?
<p>
First, be mindful of what is going on around the exterior of your house. There was a pool of water standing up against the foundation where the crack was. I had briefly noticed this before, but being that I spent most of my time at home indoors, I never paid much attention to it. Had I done a tiny bit of landscaping work to prevent this pool of water, the flooding may have never occurred. Also, the crack was visible on the exterior wall; a minimal routine inspection of the foundation could have led to the crack being fixed in advance of any problems.
<p>
Second, a basement can be a damp place. Even without water coming in through blatant cracks, moisture can condense on the concrete surfaces of a basement. If you’re going to put nontrivial flooring down on the concrete, such as carpeting or wood, you really should first install a subfloor with ventilation for the moisture. If your basement has already been finished, find out if you have a good subfloor in place. If not, you might want to redo the flooring and add one.
<p>
Third, take reasonable and easy precautions against moisture. Don’t store things in cardboard boxes if you can avoid it. You can get some decent plastic storage bins for less than $10 USD, and these will protect your belongings much better than cardboard. Running a dehumidifier in the basement will offer another layer of protection against moisture buildup. If you want to monitor how dry things are, you can put a moisture meter in the basement and let it alert you if the moisture level increases.
<p>
Your home is your safe harbor from the rest of the world. Take care of it!

[<i>Postscript: While I have not enjoyed dealing with these issues in the basement, I do not at all mean to imply that my situation was a flooding catastrophe. There have recently been many homes quite thoroughly ruined by weather, including numerous houses and businesses a short drive from where I live. My problem was thankfully mundane in comparison, and no amount of installing DriCore panels or inspecting the foundation would have saved houses destroyed in "real" floods. I share my experience here in hopes of helping people mitigate day-to-day water problems in the basement.</i>]
