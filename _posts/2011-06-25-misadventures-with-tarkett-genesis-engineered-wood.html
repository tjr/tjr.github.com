title: Misadventures with Tarkett Genesis Engineered Wood Flooring
layout: post

<p><div>

Progress on redoing the basement floor continues. With the <a href="http://www.dricore.com/">DriCore panels</a> in place, we turned our attention toward the new flooring. After some deliberation, I selected <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/buy/flooring/hardwood-flooring/tarkett/genesis-red-oak-natural-3-8-in-x-41-4-in-x-random-lengths-engineered-real-hardwood-flooring-14048.html">Tarkett Genesis Red Oak engineered wood flooring</a>. Designed to &#8220;lock in place&#8221; rather than need to be nailed down, this seemed like a good option, and it was a nice light wood color that I enjoyed.

Unfortunately, it seems that I must have selected one of the worst engineered wood flooring products on the planet.

After getting in the last of the DriCore panels, we put down one row of flooring and called it quits for the night. The following day, one of the pieces of flooring was curled up (slightly, but enough that I deemed it unusable). But more problematically, the second row was all but impossible to install.

I managed to get one piece to &#8220;lock in place&#8221; with another piece; after that, it was a mess. Nothing was locking in place. The instruction booklet made it look simple, but in the vast majority of attempts, the best we could get was for two pieces to be almost connected, forming a slight V-shape between them.

We finally gave up and hauled nine boxes of Tarkett Genesis back to Home Depot, who graciously gave us cash back, no questions asked. Their staff said that they had never before seen someone return Tarkett Genesis engineered wood flooring, but they had also never seen anyone purchase any&#8230;

Back in the flooring aisle, we tried a bunch of other options, including pulling full-size pieces of out of boxes to ensure they connected properly. It seemed that everything else we looked at locked in place without a problem, leading me to conclude that Tarkett Genesis engineered wood flooring is best avoided.

To replace the Tarkett Genesis, we bought ten boxes of <a href="http://www.lowes.com/pd_142831-28573-609LS_4294856494__?productId=1135395&amp;Ntt=bamboo+floor&amp;pl=1&amp;currentURL=%2Fpl_Hardwood%2BFlooring%2BAccessories_4294856494__s%3FNtt%3Dbamboo%2Bfloor&amp;facetInfo=">bamboo flooring</a> at Lowe&#8217;s (which is acclimating to the humidity level in the basement as I write this). The flooring associate at Lowe&#8217;s expressed disgust with Tarkett Genesis products before we even told him what happened.
