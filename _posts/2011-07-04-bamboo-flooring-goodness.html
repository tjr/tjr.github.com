title: Bamboo Flooring Goodness
layout: post
---
<p>After about six hours of effort, we have roughly half of the basement floor covered with <a href="http://www.lowes.com/pd_142831-28573-609LS_4294856494__?productId=1135395&amp;Ntt=bamboo+floor&amp;pl=1&amp;currentURL=%2Fpl_Hardwood%2BFlooring%2BAccessories_4294856494__s%3FNtt%3Dbamboo%2Bfloor&amp;facetInfo=">bamboo flooring panels</a>. These are very easy to install, and vastly superior to the other flooring that I tried earlier. Before working on the second half of the basement, we are going to reinstall floorboard trim on the first half, and put furniture back in place.</p>

<p>Working in copious free time, I expect that we&#8217;ll be totally done within a couple more weeks, with at least the first half of the basement being a usable, livable space again by this upcoming weekend. This has all taken much longer than I expected, but we&#8217;re almost there!</p>
