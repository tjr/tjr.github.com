title: Bamboo Flooring Goodness
---
<p>
After about six hours of effort, we have roughly half of the basement floor covered with bamboo flooring panels. These are very easy to install, and vastly superior to the other flooring that I tried earlier. Before working on the second half of the basement, we are going to reinstall floorboard trim on the first half, and put furniture back in place.

Working in copious free time, I expect that we’ll be totally done within a couple more weeks, with at least the first half of the basement being a usable, livable space again by this upcoming weekend. This has all taken much longer than I expected, but we’re almost there!
