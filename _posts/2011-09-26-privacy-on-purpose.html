title: Privacy on Purpose
---

<p>
Social networking websites have increasingly been the target of
privacy concerns, with
Facebook's <a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/04/facebook-timeline">ever-changing
notion of privacy</a> being of especial interest recently.

<p>
In some respects, reduced privacy can be a good thing. Facebook can
collect all sorts of data about us, analyzing what we like and what we
might be interested in, and then hand some subset of this data over to
third-party advertisers, so that they can improve their advertisement
targeting and increase sales.

<p>
The idea of getting well-targeted advertising, frankly, I find
appealing. I want to be made aware of products or services that I
would actually like. Perhaps the main reason that people are so
ad-averse is that we've been subjected to multitudes of ads for
products that we have absolutely no interest in.

<p>
But should we trust that Facebook and everyone who it shares its data
with will use this data only to improve our lives with better
advertising? Is it not conceivable that someone &mdash; maybe Facebook
itself, or maybe another organization with access to its data &mdash; will
use this information for less-than-noble purposes?

<p>
One feature of Facebook that has been
getting <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2011/09/24/facebookIsScaringMe.html">a
lot of attention lately</a> is that of allowing third-party Facebook
applications to post information to your Facebook account. There are
some obvious benefits to this technology; for example, if you also
have a Twitter account, you could authorize Twitter to post to your
Facebook account, so that rather than posting the same update text on
both websites, you post it once on Twitter, and it gets automatically
posted to your Facebook account as well.

<p>
Technically, though, it doesn't end there. The Twitter application
could, in theory, start posting more content to your Facebook account
that you did not write. To my knowledge, Twitter does not do this, but
the technology is in place such that it could.

<p>
Other applications, however, do in fact do this. As of this writing,
if you link your Facebook account
with <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/washington-post-social-reader-editors-note/2011/09/22/gIQARauCoK_story.html">The
Washington Post</a> and authorize it to make posts to your Facebook
account, it will post messages
displaying <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/read_in_facebook_social_news_apps.php">every
Washington Post article that you open in your web browser.

<p>
<a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3033693">Should this
bother us</a>? What if, out of abstract curiosity, you read an article
about the proper way to resign from a job? If this information made
its way to your manager at work, he might get the idea that your are
contemplating resigning. Or what if you read an article about how to
quit smoking? If this information made its way to your health
insurance company, they may get the impression that you smoke, even if
you tell them that you don't.

<p>
Would things like this actually happen? We might feel content to say
“probably not,” though it could be embarrassing, awkward, or costly
for us if we turned out to be wrong.

<p>
Of course, we don't have to authorize The Washington Post to be able
to add content to our Facebook accounts. We don't have to authorize
anyone besides ourselves. But we need to be on guard and watchful with
respect to these matters.

<p>
Just last week, after reading about some of these issues in the news,
I looked at the application settings on my Facebook account; I was
surprised to find several applications that had authorization to post
to my account that I had absolutely no recollection of ever using
before. Even as aware as I am about privacy matters, somehow these
slipped by me. How much more if someone isn't being careful at all?

<p>
This whole internet privacy thing is, in the grand scheme of life on
the planet, pretty shiny and new. I don't think any of us fully
understand the possible repercussions of losing privacy on the
internet. There are things we choose to make public, but it should be
a conscious choice on our part, rather than an accident because we
neglected to pay attention.
