title: Privacy on Purpose
layout: post
---
<p>Social networking websites have increasingly been the target of privacy concerns, with Facebook&#8217;s <a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/04/facebook-timeline">ever-changing notion of privacy</a> being of especial interest recently.</p>

<p>In some respects, reduced privacy can be a good thing. Facebook can collect all sorts of data about us, analyzing what we like and what we might be interested in, and then hand some subset of this data over to third-party advertisers, so that they can improve their advertisement targeting and increase sales.</p>

<p>The idea of getting well-targeted advertising, frankly, I find appealing. I <em>want</em> to be made aware of products or services that I would actually like. Perhaps the main reason that people are so ad-averse is that we&#8217;ve been subjected to multitudes of ads for products that we have absolutely no interest in.</p>

<p>But should we trust that Facebook and everyone who it shares its data with will use this data only to improve our lives with better advertising? Is it not conceivable that someone — maybe Facebook itself, or maybe another organization with access to its data — will use this information for less-than-noble purposes?</p>

<p>One feature of Facebook that has been getting <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2011/09/24/facebookIsScaringMe.html">a lot of attention lately</a> is that of allowing third-party Facebook applications to post information to your Facebook account. There are some obvious benefits to this technology; for example, if you also have a Twitter account, you could authorize Twitter to post to your Facebook account, so that rather than posting the same update text on both websites, you post it once on Twitter, and it gets automatically posted to your Facebook account as well.</p>

<p>Technically, though, it doesn&#8217;t end there. The Twitter application could, in theory, start posting more content to your Facebook account that you did not write. To my knowledge, Twitter does not do this, but the technology is in place such that it could.</p>

<p>Other applications, however, do in fact do this. As of this writing, if you link your Facebook account with <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/washington-post-social-reader-editors-note/2011/09/22/gIQARauCoK_story.html">The Washington Post</a> and authorize it to make posts to your Facebook account, it will post messages displaying <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/read_in_facebook_social_news_apps.php">every Washington Post article</a> that you open in your web browser.</p>

<p><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3033693">Should this bother us</a>? What if, out of abstract curiosity, you read an article about the proper way to resign from a job? If this information made its way to your manager at work, he might get the idea that your are contemplating resigning. Or what if you read an article about how to quit smoking? If this information made its way to your health insurance company, they may get the impression that you smoke, even if you tell them that you don&#8217;t.</p>

<p>Would things like this actually happen? We might feel content to say &#8220;probably not,&#8221; though it could be embarrassing, awkward, or costly for us if we turned out to be wrong.</p>

<p>Of course, we don&#8217;t have to authorize The Washington Post to be able to add content to our Facebook accounts. We don&#8217;t have to authorize anyone besides ourselves. But we need to be on guard and watchful with respect to these matters.</p>

<p>Just last week, after reading about some of these issues in the news, I looked at the application settings on my Facebook account; I was surprised to find several applications that had authorization to post to my account that I had absolutely no recollection of ever using before. Even as aware as I am about privacy matters, somehow these slipped by me. How much more if someone isn&#8217;t being careful at all?</p>

<p>This whole internet privacy thing is, in the grand scheme of life on the planet, pretty shiny and new. I don&#8217;t think any of us fully understand the possible repercussions of losing privacy on the internet. There are things we choose to make public, but it should be a conscious choice on our part, rather than an accident because we neglected to pay attention.</p>
