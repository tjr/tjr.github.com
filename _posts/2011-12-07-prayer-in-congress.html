<p>
It is common to hear news of some court or another ruling that matters
such as
the <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2010-04-15-prayer-day_N.htm">National
Day of
Prayer</a>, <a href="http://www.civilrights.org/monitor/vol11_no4/art2p1.html">school-sponsored
prayer</a>, <a href="http://articles.sfgate.com/2005-09-14/news/17390892_1_appeals-public-classrooms-pledge">reciting
the Pledge of Allegiance</a> in public
schools</a>, <a href="http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&address=102x3088539">state-funded
Christian prison ministry</a>, and a slew
of <a href="http://www.aclu.org/religion-belief/ohio-appeals-court-strikes-down-christian-state-motto-unconstitutional">other
religious-oriented things</a> to be unconstitutional, specifically in
violation of the
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a>.

<p>
I happened to be perusing recent congretional records, and noticed that the following
prayer was spoken in the <a href="http://www.house.gov/">House of Representatives</a>
by guest chaplain Pastor Bryan Thiessen on 6 December 2011:

<blockquote>
Father, we thank You for this Nation, Your love, and, most of all,
Your forgiveness of sins.
<p>
We acknowledge, as Scripture states in James 1:5, that You are the
giver of all wisdom. May You give these men and women, whom You
have placed in leadership over this Nation, Your wisdom in all
their deeds and discussions.
<p>
According to Romans 13, ``Let everyone be subject to the governing
authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has
established.'' May these here be good stewards of this responsibility,
leadership, and Your gift of freedom for our Nation.
<p>
We ask for Your special protection over our military and blessing for
their families. We pray for our enemies, as You instruct us in Matthew
5:44. May their plans be thwarted, and may they come to the love and
grace that You offer.
<p>
In the only name through whom man can be saved, Jesus Christ. Amen. 
</blockquote>

<p>
Following this prayer, Representative <a href="http://fleischmann.house.gov/">Chuck
Fleischmann</a> led the Pledge of Allegiance:

<blockquote>
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and
to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God,
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
</blockquote>

<p>
Afterwards, Representative <a href="http://murphy.house.gov/">Tim
Murphy</a> of Pennsylvania presented a short biography of guest
chaplain Thiessen, and stated that the the House of Representatives
is "excited to hear the words of the Lord he has chosen to share
with us today".
