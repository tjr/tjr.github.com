<p>It is common to hear news of some court or another ruling that matters such as the <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2010-04-15-prayer-day_N.htm">National Day of Prayer</a>, <a href="http://www.civilrights.org/monitor/vol11_no4/art2p1.html">school-sponsored prayer</a>, <a href="http://articles.sfgate.com/2005-09-14/news/17390892_1_appeals-public-classrooms-pledge">reciting the Pledge of Allegiance</a> in public schools, <a href="http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&amp;address=102x3088539">state-funded Christian prison ministry</a>, and a slew of <a href="http://www.aclu.org/religion-belief/ohio-appeals-court-strikes-down-christian-state-motto-unconstitutional">other religious-oriented things</a> to be unconstitutional, specifically in violation of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a>.

I happened to be perusing recent congressional records, and noticed that the following prayer was spoken in the <a href="http://www.house.gov/">House of Representatives</a> by guest chaplain Pastor Bryan Thiessen on 6 December 2011:
</p><blockquote>Father, we thank You for this Nation, Your love, and, most of all, Your forgiveness of sins.We acknowledge, as Scripture states in James 1:5, that You are the giver of all wisdom. May You give these men and women, whom You have placed in leadership over this Nation, Your wisdom in all their deeds and discussions.

According to Romans 13, &#8220;Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established.&#8221; May these here be good stewards of this responsibility, leadership, and Your gift of freedom for our Nation.

We ask for Your special protection over our military and blessing for their families. We pray for our enemies, as You instruct us in Matthew 5:44. May their plans be thwarted, and may they come to the love and grace that You offer.

In the only name through whom man can be saved, Jesus Christ. Amen.</blockquote>
Following this prayer, Representative <a href="http://fleischmann.house.gov/">Chuck Fleischmann</a> led the Pledge of Allegiance:
<blockquote>I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.</blockquote>
Afterwards, Representative <a href="http://murphy.house.gov/">Tim Murphy</a> of Pennsylvania presented a short biography of guest chaplain Thiessen, and stated that the the House of Representatives is &#8220;excited to hear the words of the Lord he has chosen to share with us today&#8221;.

If the popular concept of &#8220;separation of church and state&#8221; were indeed demanded by the constitution, then would not the members of congress — the custodians of federal law themselves — be compelled to enforce it upon their own proceedings? Or perhaps religion and government constitutionally mix better than some might have us believe?

You can see the congressional record for this day via <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/R?r112:FLD001:H08143">the Library of Congress archive</a>.
