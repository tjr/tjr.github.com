title: Guiding Toward Licensing

<p>
I enjoy taking photographs, and I like to share them with others
via the web. Years ago, I used to store my shared photographs
directly on my own website. This let me showcase the photos
exactly as I wanted to, but it was in some ways inconvenient. I
decided that I wanted to share my photos using some other web
service specifically designed for it.

<p> At the time, the two major contenders that I saw were <a
href="http://picasaweb.google.com/">Google Picasaweb</a> and <a
href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a>. I tried using free accounts
on both of them, and when my photo uploads began to approach the
limitations of the free accounts, I opted to give my credit card
number to Flickr, signing up for a <a
href="http://flickr.com/photos/trothwell/">professional
account.</a>

<p> After returning from a trip to Mexico, a fellow traveller
tried to download the full-size versions of some of my
photographs. He told me that he was unable to; Flickr wouldn't
allow the download.  I was not intending to restrict downloads of my
photographs, so I looked into it. It turned out that I was using
the default Flickr option of retaining "all rights reserved" on
my photographs, and in Flickrland, that meant that other users
could only view small-size versions of my pictures.

<p> I looked at the other options available, which were all
various <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/">Creative
Commons licenses</a>. While I was fairly liberal with my photo
sharing, I had never before considered explicitly using a
Creative Commons license. So I selected the one that I thought
best matched how I wanted to allow the world to use my
pictures (Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs) and set Flickr to
automatically use this license for all existing and future photos
in my account.

<p> Being that the only options for photo licenses on Flickr are
Creative Commons licenses or "all rights reserved", I wonder how
many other people have been quietly, subtly swayed toward using a
Creative Commons license that wouldn't have done so otherwise?

<p> As a professional software engineer, I further got to
wondering about if development tools such as online code
repositories could similarly sway programmers toward particular
licenses or development methodologies?

<p> <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a>, for instance</a>,
offers a very nice web interface and completely free-of-charge
hosting for source code that you are willing to show
publicly. They make no demands on using a particular license,
just that only paying users can have private code repositories.

<p> What if an online code repository system even better than
GitHub came along, and was free of charge to use only if you
elected to distribute your code under one of the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/">GNU GPL</a> licenses? Or only
if you committed to author code with unit tests? Or only if you
were willing to subject your program to usability spot checks?
Can providing an outstanding code repository experience free of
charge usefully implement restrictions that would sway people
into opting for a development or distribution strategy that they
would not have otherwise done on their own?

<p> But not so harshly that users would elect to do something
against their will. As a Flickr users, I found the Creative Commons
license to be agreeable for my purposes. But I almost certainly
would never have used it without Flickr guiding me in that direction.
