<p>Apple has announced a revision to their <a href="http://www.apple.com/education/ibooks-textbooks/">iBooks book reader</a>, toward supporting interactive textbooks, and along with it, an <a href="http://www.apple.com/ibooks-author/">iBooks Author application</a> for developing these textbooks.</p>

<p>This appears to be a most excellent technology. The iPad is a great device for consuming multimedia, and the ability to bring real-time interactivity to educational materials will surely open up new doors in learning. Likewise, this is a good opportunity for folks interested in developing educational materials. If Apple&#8217;s music and phone application stores are any indication, people who take development of interactive textbooks seriously should be able to both reach a large audience and make a nice profit.</p>

<p>For all of these reasons, and more, I am excited. But as with digital rights management on non-interactive books, I wonder what path this wonderful educational resource will lead us down with respect to proprietary technology. Interactive iBooks appear to be based on the open EPub3 file format, so it should be possible for authors and publishers to avoid getting locked in to iPads in particular. I guess we need to stay tuned, and pay attention, to see if there is in fact anything to be concerned about here.</p>

<p>But for the moment, I am going to focus on my excitement, and plan to start learning how to develop interactive iBooks this week&#8230;</p>

<p>UPDATE: Turns out that the iBooks Author software requires OS X Lion. I&#8217;m still using OS X Snow Leopard due to running Lion-incompatible <a href="http://www.mackie.com/products/tracktion3/">Mackie Tracktion</a> for audio production work. I guess the time has come for me to figure out my plan for getting off of Tracktion.</p>

<p>And it also looks like someone was paying attention and <a href="http://venomousporridge.com/post/16126436616/ibooks-author-eula-audacity">found something disconcerting</a> in the iBooks Author EULA.</p>
