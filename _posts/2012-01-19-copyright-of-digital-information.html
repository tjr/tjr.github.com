title: Copyright of Digital Information
layout: post
---
<p>Today warnings of problems with the proposed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act">Stop Online Piracy Act</a> filled the internet. Perusing and participating in discussions, I read several interesting ideas from opposing perspectives.</p>

<p>Some people feel strongly that copyright of digital materials is nonsensical, and trying to apply copyright to pure information is only clinging to the ways of the past. One of the most compelling arguments I encountered in favor of this perspective was that trying to enforce copyright law on works that can be endlessly copied and redistributed for effectively no cost creates an artificial scarcity of the works.</p>

<p>In the physical world, some things are more scarce than others. There simply isn&#8217;t as much gold as there is dirt, for instance. But what if we could, for next to zero cost, make infinite copies of gold? It would hardly be scarce any more.</p>

<p>Once a digital work (an MP3 file, a PDF document, a software application, etc.) has been created, the effort is done. Making copies for people to use is all but effortless. There is no actual scarcity of digital works. It is only because we as a society govern ourselves by copyright laws that digital copies of songs and movies and books are viewed as having any monetary value.</p>

<p>Why, then, should we impose artificial scarcity to digital works? Once they are created, why not use the technology we have to grant access everyone who wishes to have a copy?</p>

<p>I found this line of reasoning compelling, but not totally convincing.</p>

<p>As I mentioned in an <a title="Guiding Toward Licensing" href="http://www.trevisrothwell.co.uk/2011/12/guiding-toward-licensing/">earlier post</a>, I make my published photographs available under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/">Creative Commons license</a>. This effectively lets anyone who wants a copy to be able to have a copy. No artificial scarcity here. But there&#8217;s more to the story.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/">Creative Commons license that I chose</a> for my photographs does not permit you to adapt my photographs into your own work of art. It does not permit you to use my photographs for commercial purposes. You can print out a copy, hang it on your wall, view it on your computer, give copies to your friends&#8230; but there are limits to what rights I grant you through the license.</p>

<p>As the creator of the digital works, I do not feel comfortable with the idea that my photographs could be integrated into another work of art that I might find risqu√© or inappropriate. I do not feel comfortable granting permission <em>carte blanche</em> for you to use my photographs to promote a business that I may find objectionable. Indeed, for commercial purposes, I am legally restrained from letting you use any of my photographs that portray recognizable people without first obtaining a release from those people.</p>

<p>In any event, you are more than welcome to ask my permission, and I may well grant you additional rights beyond the Creative Commons license. But I wish to limit what rights I automatically grant to the general public.</p>

<p>So what, then? I need to be able to apply copyright to my digital works. I want to both publish my photographs for all to be able to see, enjoy, copy, and share, but I want and need to be able to also restrict some uses of my photographs. If I were to accept that, since making digital copies is trivially easy, concepts of copyright are thus irrelevant, then I would not be able to in any way legally restrict how others use my photographs.</p>

<p>The same is true for other forms of digital works, of course. Some free software licenses, the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html">GNU General Public License</a> for example, both grant rights and restrict usages. Nothing could be restricted without application of copyright law.</p>

<p>Of course, the &#8220;big deal&#8221; with respect to applying copyright law to digital works, at least the issue that seems to be of most concern to politicians and the news media, is that enforcing copyright on digital works makes it feasible to sell copies of digital works for a fee. In my opinion, this too is important. While I am delighted when someone enjoys my digital works for free, I am likewise happy if they enjoy my work enough to pay for it. But I find that feasibility of collecting payments is only part of the picture; there are additional more idealistic reasons why it doesn&#8217;t make sense to me to discard copyright for digital works.</p>

<p>What do you think? Is copyright a relic of the past in the digital age? Or does it still serve a useful purpose beyond its original physical-copy goals?</p>
