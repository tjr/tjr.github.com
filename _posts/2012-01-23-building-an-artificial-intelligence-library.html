title: Building an Artificial Intelligence Library
layout: post
---
<p>Lacking ready access to a good research library, I routinely add artificial intelligence materials to my personal collection. There are numerous <a href="http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/5458">good resources on the web</a>, but sometimes a printed book is what you&#8217;re after. And amazingly, you can often appropriate gently used copies of those books for extremely low prices.</p>

<p>For example, I was just looking up the book <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=3934">Thinking Between the Lines</a>, currently out of print, with new copies (for as long as they are available) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Between-Lines-Comprehension-Descriptions/dp/0262023741/">selling for $50 USD</a>.</p>

<p>Used copies are presently available through Amazon third-party retailers <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/0262023741/ref=dp_olp_used?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327295930&amp;sr=8-2&amp;condition=used">starting at one cent</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure how selling at such low prices could benefit the sellers, but they set their own price, and I just bought a copy ($4 USD for one in like-new condition). Thank you, <a href="http://www.mahlerbooks.com/">Mahler Books</a> of Austin, Texas!</p>
