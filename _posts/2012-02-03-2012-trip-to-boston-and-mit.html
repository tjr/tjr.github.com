<p>I got back home yesterday from taking an intense <a href="http://philip.greenspun.com/teaching/rdbms-iap-2012">three-day programming class</a> at <a href="http://web.mit.edu/iap/">MIT</a>. As usual, the Boston area is a delight to visit, and MIT is a fascinating place to hang out (at least if you&#8217;re into science and engineering).

The weather was delightfully unseasonably warm, making the mile-long trek from the hotel to the classroom quite reasonably pleasant.
