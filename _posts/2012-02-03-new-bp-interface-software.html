title: New BP Interface Software
layout: post
---
<p>Stopping for gas at the area BP station this evening, I was pleasantly surprised to see that they have updated the software behind their self-service gas pump interfaces: when you press &#8220;Yes&#8221; it instantly accepts a &#8220;Yes&#8221;, and when you press &#8220;No&#8221; it instantly accepts a &#8220;No&#8221;. Very nice.</p>

<p>In the past, when declining the offer to purchase a car wash, I found myself pressing &#8220;No&#8221; repeatedly several dozen times before the system finally registered by response, but on the rare occasions I did want to get a car wash, it managed to accept my &#8220;Yes&#8221; response immediately&#8230;</p>
