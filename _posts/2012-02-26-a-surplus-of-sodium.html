title: A Surplus of Sodium
layout: post
---
<p>The <a href="http://www.nih.gov/">National Institutes of Health</a> website (brought to us courtesy of the United States government) suggests that we should consume no more than <a href="http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/hbp/prevent/sodium/sodium.htm">2400 milligrams of sodium each day</a>. How much sodium are we eating every day, totally unaware? Here are some sodium numbers that surprised me:
</p><ul><li>Campbell&#8217;s Healthy Request Beef with Country Vegetables Soup: 410 milligrams per serving (820 in a whole can)</li>
	<li>Wendy&#8217;s Grilled Chicken Sandwich: 1080 milligrams</li>
	<li>Mrs. Grimes Dark Red Kidney Beans: 390 milligrams per serving (1365 in a whole can)</li>
	<li>McCormick Reduced-Sodium Taco Seasoning: 300 milligrams per serving (1800 in a whole package)</li>
</ul>
And some less surprising (though still astonishing) sodium numbers:
<ul><li>Taco Bell 1/2-pound Cheesy Potato Burrito: 1360 milligrams</li>
	<li>Arby&#8217;s French Dip &amp; Swiss: 2120 milligrams</li>
	<li>McDonald&#8217;s Big Breakfast with Hotcakes: 2150 milligrams</li>
	<li>Taco John&#8217;s Potato Oles Scrambler with Bacon: 3510 milligrams</li>
</ul>
But even with less outlandish sodium counts, it seems very easy to go well beyond the daily recommended amount of sodium without trying very hard, even while thinking you are eating in a perfectly healthy manner. Why isn&#8217;t our modern 100-calorie-cupcake-pack society more interested in maintaining sane levels of sodium intake?
