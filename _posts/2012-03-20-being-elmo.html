<p>I stumbled upon <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1787660/">a fascinating documentary</a> about Muppet performer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Clash">Kevin Clash</a>, which provides insight into his journey from being intrigued by watching Sesame Street to being an executive producer of the show and responsible for one of its most successful characters.</p>

<p>Like many children, I imagine, I too was captivated by the Muppets, making some attempts at building my own puppets (initially out of construction paper, and eventually working my way up to foam rubber and fabric), all the while in the back of my mind occasionally wondering how someone could land a job actually working as a Muppet performer.</p>

<p>The film gives some clue as to what it would take, namely, a lot more dedication to puppetry than I&#8217;ve ever expressed! But what impressed me the most was that Kevin&#8217;s story serves as an example of deciding to do something in life and working hard at it. I think too often people idly wish something would happen in their lives but never actually take steps toward seeing it comes to pass.</p>
