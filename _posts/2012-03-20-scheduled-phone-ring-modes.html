title: Scheduled Phone Ring Modes

<p>Sitting in church on Sunday, I heard someone&#8217;s mobile phone ring during the service. This is not unusual; it happens every few weeks or so. It&#8217;s easy to forgot to turn it off.
<p>
I wonder: would it be useful to be able to schedule your mobile phone ring mode, similar to how you schedule calendar alarms? For example:
</p><ul><li>Sunday 10am - 12pm (church): silent</li>
	<li>Monday through Friday, 8am - 5pm (regular working hours): vibrate</li>
	<li>Tuesday 9am - 10am (weekly staff meeting): silent</li>
	<li>Friday 6pm - 8pm (Parcheesi tournament): silent</li>
	<li>All other times: normal ring</li>
</ul>
You could also integrate this with your calendar, so that when you schedule an event (a haircut, a meeting, whatever) you could specify a ring mode for that particular day and time.
<p>
[I personally don't enter my regular weekly schedule into my calendar,
just the unique differences. For those who enter everything into their
calendar, this entire system could be implemented by letting calendar
entries specify ring mode, and that might be the most elegant way of
making it work.]

<p>
Of course, you could override all of this with a switch, to turn the
phone completely silent, but I imagine a lot of people have fairly
regular schedules of when they want their phone to ring, vibrate, or
remain silent.

I don't think I can just "write an app for that", since this is a core
functionality of the phone itself, but for any phone operating system
designers out there, this might be a worthwhile feature!
