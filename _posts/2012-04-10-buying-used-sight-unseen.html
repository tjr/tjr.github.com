title: Buying Used, Sight Unseen
layout: post
---
<p>I&#8217;ve heard mixed stories about buying used camera equipment, ranging from recommending it in order to extend your equipment budget, to describing it with disdain as being too much of a gamble. So far, every SLR camera and lens that I have purchased has been new, but I thought I would try my hand at ordering a used lens. Today I received a used Canon 85mm/1.8 lens, described by the seller (a reputable camera dealer) as being in good/excellent condition.</p>
<p>A quick inspection of the lens suggested that it was slightly dinged up, but appeared to be pretty good. The glass looked clean. I put it on my camera, and took Samantha outside for some test pictures. Even with a fast maximum aperture of 1.8, it was hard to capture any non-blurry shots of Samantha running through the yard&#8230;</p>

<p>After about fifteen shots, the camera (Canon 5D) suddenly locked up and displayed &#8220;ERR&#8221; status. That has only happened to me once or twice with this camera, since 2006. Could be a coincidence, but it seems odd that it happened after putting this new (used) lens on. I restarted the camera and took about 50 more pictures of Samantha without problem.</p>
<p>Back inside, I examined the lens more carefully, and noticed that the manual focus ring seemed to exhibit more than expected friction when turning. Autofocus seemed reasonably smooth, but focus by hand was a little tough and a little loud. Finally I more closely examined the glass elements of the lens, and observed dust on the inside of the lens. Not a big deal in terms of image quality, but it just heightened my suspicions that the lens wasn&#8217;t quite up to par. So I packaged it back up in the box to return.</p>
<p>As far as the 85mm/1.8 lens in general, it appears to be a good short-telephoto portrait lens, which is exactly what I was expecting. I didn&#8217;t keep this lens long enough to try it out on any people, and Samantha wouldn&#8217;t sit still long enough for me to get a good portrait of her, but some other tests look positive.</p>

<p>So I guess I&#8217;ll be ordering a new one after all, and forgoing the expected savings&#8230;</p>
