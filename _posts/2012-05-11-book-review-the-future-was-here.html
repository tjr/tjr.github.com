As a former user of an Amiga 3000 computer, I have been looking forward to reading this book, which opens with a short overview of the platform:</p>
<p>The Amiga 1000 was introduced in 1985, amid aesthetically bland and technologically limited IBM personal computers and the then-monochrome Apple Macintosh. In comparison, the Amiga offered &#8220;a palette of 4,096 colors, screen resolutions up to 640x400, four-channel digital stereo sound, true preemptive multitasking&#8221; and more.</p>
<p>Computer journalists struggled to understand just what practical implications these sorts of new features would hold for users. Many wrote about how the Amiga would surely advance the world of computing, though not everyone saw the potential. &#8220;There are products now that address every need of the business person,&#8221; said computer retailer Bert Helfinstein. &#8220;Why add another one unless there is a compelling reason? And in [the case of the Amiga], that compelling reason doesn&#8217;t exist.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maher spends the rest of the book showing us compelling reasons why the Amiga was indeed a groundbreaking computer: &#8220;the world&#8217;s first true multimedia PC.&#8221; Descriptions range from technical historical journalism reminiscent of classic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_%28magazine%29">Byte magazine</a>articles, to surprisingly in-depth (yet layman-friendly) computer science surveys to help us understand how the Amiga hardware and software was wired together.</p>
<p>I am delighted with the level of detail and behind-the-scenes trivia that Maher has provided. Some interesting bits that stood out to me:</p>
<ul><li>The origins of the IFF file format to allow Amiga users to more easily share data across applications</li>
<li>The selection of the name &#8220;Amiga&#8221; in order to appear before &#8220;Apple&#8221; and &#8220;Atari&#8221; in alphabetical corporate directories</li>
<li>Inner workings of Deluxe Paint&#8217;s &#8220;undo&#8221; functionality, which explain some of its odd behavior that might not have been understood from the surface</li>
<li>A thorough overview of the original &#8220;boing&#8221; bouncing ball demo that kicked off the Amiga&#8217;s graphics-producing fame</li>
<li>A novice-friendly introduction to the concepts of 3D graphics creation</li>
</ul><p>I always knew that the Amiga platform was ahead of its time, but it is fascinating to gain more insight into just how advanced it was, and how clever its developers were with the resources they had to work with.</p>
<p>There are a number of illustrations included in the book, but I imagine it would be perfectly readable in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007V5BVJG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=trevrothswebl-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B007V5BVJG">Kindle format</a> as well. Also available as an eBook <a href="http://mitpress-ebooks.mit.edu/product/future-was-here">directly from the publisher</a>.</p>
