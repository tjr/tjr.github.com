<p>Last year, in the face of repairing my <a title="Flooding: the Catalyst for Extreme Decluttering" href="http://www.trevisrothwell.com/blog/2011/05/flooding-the-catalyst-for-extreme-decluttering/">water-damaged basement office area</a>, I went on a bit of a decluttering rampage. While in some cases I had to painfully severe illogical emotional ties to various inanimate objects, on the whole I was happy with the results, and really haven&#8217;t missed anything that I cleared out.</p>

<p>Until this week, when I got to wondering, now where did I put my computer science journals? I know I recycled the magazines, but I kept the journals, didn&#8217;t I? Oops, I guess not. Yeah, I kind of wish I had kept those&#8230;</p>
