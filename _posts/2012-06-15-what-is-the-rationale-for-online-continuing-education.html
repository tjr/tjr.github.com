title: What is the rationale for online continuing education?
layout: post
---
<p>Online classes consist of (possibly pre-recorded) lecture videos, online forums meant to simulate in-class discussions, assignments, exams, and grades. Superficially, it&#8217;s a lot like taking a class in person, except, you&#8217;re not actually there. Is there a compelling reason to enroll in online classes? Let&#8217;s think about what they offer:</p>
<p>Video lectures? There are lots of video lectures available online for free now, but even so, there is reason to believe that lecturing is not necessarily the best form of disseminating information. Great lecturers are worth listening to, but many lecturers are effectively reading the textbook to you. I can read books on my own.</p>
<p>Online forums? These are available online for free. Perhaps not concentrated on a particular course topic, but you can probably find reasonable online discussion of most things you&#8217;d want to learn about.</p>
<p>Assignments? Exams? You can cull interesting practice work out of a textbook.</p>
<p>Grades? This is the only thing you really can&#8217;t get outside of a formal course.</p>
<p>If the class is covering a topic that is new to you, being guided by a structured course may be valuable. For example, I know little about neurobiology. I could buy a book on the subject, but having the guidance (even pre-recorded guidance) of an expert in the field would likely help me to come up to speed faster.</p>
<p>But what about continuing education in your chosen field? Armed with a computer science bachelor&#8217;s degree, I feel that I am pretty well prepared to tackle learning any computer science topic on my own. I might <em>enjoy</em> taking an online class in computer science, but what value does it hold for me beyond using that same time to study a book and write some programs to reinforce my understanding?</p>
<p>I hasten to point out, <a href="http://www.trevisrothwell.com/writing/what-i-learned-at-mit">owning a book is not the same as studying a book</a>. Sometimes, especially for very challenging subjects, it can be helpful to apply pressure to yourself in the form of a course to motivate keeping with it. And I&#8217;m sure there are depths of computer science that I wish that I knew more about but have been too lazy to force myself to learn.</p>
<p>Perhaps the value of online continuing education can be attributed simply to our own quirks and shortcomings. Just as we may be more likely to lose weight when handing over money to attend Weight Watchers every week, or just as we may be more likely to build muscle if we have a gym membership, we may be more likely to fill our minds with constructive knowledge rather than with sitcoms if we put ourselves into a class situation that demands it. We could lose weight on our own. We could build muscle on our own. We could study academics on our own. But do we?</p>
<p>Before signing up for an online course, it may be worth asking, &#8220;Is this something I can learn on my own? And if so, am I sufficiently motivated to learn it at the breadth and depth that I desire to learn?&#8221; If not, then an online class may be a helpful means of staying on track.</p>
