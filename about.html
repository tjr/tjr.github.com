<h3>About Me</h3>

<p>
As a software engineer, I have worked mostly with
<a href="http://www.rockwellcollins.com/">avionics systems</a> and
web applications. I am the primary author
and maintainer of <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-c-manual/">The
GNU C Reference Manual</a> for the
<a href="http://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a>. I received
a bachelor's degree in computer science from
<a href="http://www.cornellcollege.edu/">Cornell College</a>.


<p>
As a musician, I have served my church as a player and arranger of music since
2001. In 2007 my father and I co-founded a
<a href="http://www.atmospherecontrolmusic.com/">music production company</a>.
Over the years, I've done a bit of soundtrack composing, jazz performing, and
accordion playing.

<p>
I also enjoy photography, teaching, history, fine carbonated
waters, and advocating for privacy rights & intellectual freedom principles.

<h3>About the Site Design</h3>

<p>
This web page looks not unlike something you might have seen in 1995.  I've tried numerous alternate designs for this site, including plain HTML/CSS themes, Wordpress+Wordpress themes, and paid for some sort of Adobe Photoshop-generated graphical layout that looked rather neat but was absurdly cumbersome to actually use.  In the end, I personally like this classic 1995-esque look, so I leave it at that.
