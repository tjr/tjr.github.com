<blockquote>
You think you know when you learn,
are more sure when you can write,
even more when you can teach,
but certain when you can program.<br>
-- Alan Perlis

<p>
When
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Bologna">University
of Bologna</a> opened its doors in 1088, centuries before the printing
press and a millennium before the internet, gathering dozens of students
into a room and talking at them was the best way to transmit
knowledge. Today there are lots of ways to to learn, but short of entering
the hallowed halls of academia and earning a degree, how can we demonstrate
to others what we have learned?

<p>
Perhaps what we should aim to do is to write about what we have learned;
teach others as we have opportunity; and build and create things with
what we know.

<h2>Creative Learning</h2>

<p>
In the spring of 2013, I participated in an
<a href="http://www.media.mit.edu/">MIT Media Lab</a> course on
<i>Learning Creative Learning</i>. These are some essays I wrote
as assigned activities or voluntary reflections during the course.

<li><a href="/education/informal-learning">Informal Learning</a></li>
<li><a href="/education/programming-gears">Programming Gears</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Educational Experiences</h2>
<ul>
<li>Cornell College, where I earned a degree one course at a time</li>
<li>Digital Sound Design, an online course offered by Emory University through Coursera.org</li>
<li>Relational Database Programming, a brief but intense class at MIT</li>
</ul>
