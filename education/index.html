<a href="/">Home</a> : sundry thoughts on learning

<blockquote>
You think you know when you learn,
are more sure when you can write,
even more when you can teach,
but certain when you can program.<br>
-- Alan Perlis

<p>
When
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Bologna">University
of Bologna</a> opened its doors in 1088, centuries before the printing
press and a millennium before the internet, gathering dozens of students
into a room and talking at them was a great way to transmit
knowledge. Today there are lots of ways to to learn, but short of entering
the hallowed halls of academia and earning a degree, how can we demonstrate
to others what we have learned?

<p>
Instead of being dependent upon paper credentials, perhaps what we
should aim to do is to write about what we have learned; teach others
as we have opportunity; and build and create things with what we know.

<h2>Creative Learning</h2>

<p>
In the spring of 2013, I participated in an
<a href="http://www.media.mit.edu/">MIT Media Lab</a> course on
<i>Learning Creative Learning</i>. These are some essays I wrote
as assigned activities or voluntary reflections during the course.
