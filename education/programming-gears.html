<p>
Seymour Papert's essay <i>Gears of My Childhood</i> begins when Papert
was not yet two years old. In contemplating my own "childhood gears",
I can recall early fascination with dinosaurs, as I learned of the
various kinds and the periods in which they were believed to have
lived. But while I retained a modest interest in paleontology as I
grew up, my childhood study of dinosaurs does not seem to have
impacted me in any significant way.

<p>
As I got a bit older, I developed interest in electronics. I thought
the light-emitting diodes were delightful, probably because it was so
easy to make them do something: just attach the two leads of the diode
to the two ends of a 1.5-volt battery, and it lights up! Attach them
to a 9-volt battery, and the diode shortly <i>burns up</i>, which led
me to understand the value of resistors in electronic design. Again,
though, my dabbling with electronics does not appear to have directly
influenced my life.

<p>
My parents wanted me to be prepared for what was surely going to be a
massive rise in personal computing, and my family had one or more
desktop computers almost as far back as I can remember. When I was
about nine years old, I discovered
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infocom">Infocom interactive
fiction games</a>, and was immediately pulled into these
cleverly-written imaginary worlds, all controlled by <i>typing full
sentences</i> into the computer.

<p>
In terms of relating to Papert's essay, now I'm getting somewhere.

<p>
These games expanded my vocabulary, learning new words through the
descriptive prose. They expanded my grammatical and spelling skills,
as the input sentences had to be formed correctly in order for the
program to accept them. They expanded my puzzle-solving skills, trying
to figure out how to make sense of the stories and advance through
them. They exercised my imagination, as I envisioned in my mind the
locations and characters that the game described. (Even today, I can
think back on these games and remember the pictures my imagination
painted almost as realistically as memories of places I actually went
to.)

<p>
Then when I was about eleven years old, I learned that <i>you could
write your own programs</i> to run on the computer! Amongst the sundry
bits and pieces that we got with a used Apple IIe computer was a
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Apple-users-guide-Lon-Poole/dp/0931988462/">user's
guide</a> that included chapters on programming the Apple II along with
a variety of sample programs.

<p>
Several of the samples were graphics programs; I remember one in
particular that created a moving spiral image on the screen. The
program implied that it was changing through a rainbow of colors, but
on the monochrome display it just kind of looked like slightly lighter
and darker shades of green.

<p>
Where it really got interesting for me was when I learned how to do
perhaps one of the most basic of programming tasks: get input from the
user at the keyboard, process that input, and then display an output
dependent on what the input was. I realized that understanding this
small set of ideas would let me do something that I never before thought
possible: I could write my own interactive fiction games, like Infocom's!

<p>
Well, sort of. I had no idea how to break a multi-word input into
tokens, so there was no way I could actually parse sentences. I was
limited to accepting single word commands. And I didn't really have a
good concept of structuring a program to maintain state, so the plot
of my games was limited to what I could cram into a bunch of IF/ELSE
and GOTO statements, all written basically in sequence of what I
expected the user to do.

<p>
This was hardly a game at all, really, but, as with Papert's gears, I was
figuring out how to do all of this not because someone was forcing me to
learn it, but because I wanted to learn it myself.

<p>
A few more years passed, and we traded our Apple IIe computer for a
Commodore Amiga 3000. Initially I spent some time learning how to
write programs on the Amiga, but ultimately I found its multi-media
production capabilities much more interesting, and spent several years
learning things like video editing and 3D animation.

<p>
By my last couple of years of high school, I was taking classes at the
local community college, and ended up taking an introductory
programming class, primarily to serve as some sort of general
education credit requirement. But preparing for and going through this
class, my interest in programming was rekindled, and I soon found
myself taking a study of computer science very seriously... starting
with taking what I learned in class to build interactive fiction
games, now much more well-designed and, after a few iterations,
perhaps nearly as linguistically powerful as some of the Infocom
programs.

<p>
My career as a software engineer has not yet brought me back around to
writing interactive fiction professionally, but it was the catalyst
for me learning to program computers at all, and an inspiration for
becoming proficient at it. I would like to think that interactive
fiction programs could likewise inspire children of today, but it is
worth noting that my experience with them came at a time when
text-only computer interfaces were still very common. I suspect that
not many children would be very interested in typing sentences and
reading feedback on a green text display. The more ubiquitous
graphical tablet computer applications appear superficially more
appealing, but I wonder if they will be able to generate similar
creative sparks.
