<p>
Welcome to my home page on the <a href="http://www.w3.org/history.html">World Wide Web!</a>

<p>
As a software engineer, I aim to use the tools and techniques of computer science to solve
problems faced by real people. I'm currently staying busy at work on avionics simulation software
and mobile applications.

<p>
A professional software engineer should not only write programs, but help to teach others. One of my
contributions to teaching is
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-c-manual/">The GNU C Reference Manual</a>, which I maintain
as a volunteer for <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">FSF Project GNU</a>. I have also taught
at the area community college, done some independent tutoring in Lisp programming, and spoken for
the local section of the <a href="http://www.ieee.org/">IEEE</a>.

<p>
As a musician, I have served my church as a player and arranger of music since 2001. In 2007, my
father and I co-founded a <a href="http://www.atmospherecontrolmusic.com/">music production
company</a>. Over the years, I've done a bit of soundtrack composing, jazz performing, and
accordion playing.

<h3>What's New?</h3>

<p>
I copied many of my online photographs from <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/trothwell/">the
Google Picasaweb service</a> to <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/trothwell/">Flickr</a>. I have found
the Flickr service to have a nicer interface. I have been uploading the photos afresh from my original
archives, giving opportunity for higher-resolution images in some cases, and also doing a bit of
touchup on color balance and such. I do not necessarily plan to re-upload every photo that I had in
Picasaweb, but if you notice any missing that you would like to see added, please let me know.
