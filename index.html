<p>
Welcome to my home page on the <a href="http://www.w3.org/history.html">World Wide Web!</a>

<p>
As a software engineer, I aim to use the tools and techniques of computer science to solve
problems faced by real people. I'm currently staying busy at work on avionics simulation software
and mobile applications.

<p>
A professional software engineer should not only write programs, but help to teach others. One of my
contributions to teaching is
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-c-manual/">The GNU C Reference Manual</a>, which I maintain
as a volunteer for <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">FSF Project GNU</a>. I have also taught
at the area community college, done some independent tutoring in Lisp programming, and spoken for
the local section of the <a href="http://www.ieee.org/">IEEE</a>.

<p>
As a musician, I have served my church as a player and arranger of music since 2001. In 2007, my
father and I co-founded a <a href="http://www.atmospherecontrolmusic.com/">music production
company</a>. Over the years, I've done a bit of soundtrack composing, jazz performing, and
accordion playing.
