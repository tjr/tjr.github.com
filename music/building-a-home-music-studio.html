<p>
Over the course of a century, the technology for recording music has gone from
complicated, specialized equipment to which few people had access, to fairly
easy-to-use systems that run on computers which many people already own. With
a relatively modest investment, you can have everything you need to start
producing professional-quality music recordings in your home.

<h2>Digital Audio Workstation Software</h2>

<p>
The central piece of the system is the Digital Audio Workstation software,
commonly referred to as the DAW. This is the software that you use for
recording new tracks of audio (or MIDI) data, editing the tracks, applying
effects to the tracks, and mixing the tracks down to a more or less final
output. There are numerous DAW applications to choose from.

<h3>ProTools</h3>

<p>
For
years, <a href="http://www.avid.com/US/products/family/pro-tools">ProTools</a>
has been the professional standard for DAW applications. If you are
absolutely serious about digital music production, this is the way to
go. Other DAW applications may well offer all of the features that you
need, but using ProTools will give you maximum compatibility when
exchanging files with other professional sound engineers.

<p>
It used to be the case that ProTools required special custom hardware
to work with, but the latest versions of ProTools will work with a
variety of modern digital audio interfaces (which we will look at
shortly).

<p>
What if you're not absolutely serious about digital music production?
ProTools carries a high price tag, and if you are just getting
started, it might not make sense to buy ProTools right away. Other DAW
applications will do quite nicely as you learn, and in fact, depending
on how you interact with other studios, you may never feel compelled
to buy ProTools at all.

<h2>Digital Audio Interfaces</h2>

<p>
In order to get audio into your computer, you have to have some sort
of interface hardware that converts analog audio signals into digital
data.

<h3>Built-In Microphone Input</h3>

<p>
Most modern computers have either a built-in microphone, or a built-in
1/8-inch microphone input jack, or both. This will probably be insufficient
for doing much serious work, but it can be enough to get started with.
Consider, for example, the
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1G-zwuQvEk">song demo recordings</a>
for <i>Phineas and Ferb</i>, which were recorded straight into the built-in
microphone on the computer. It doesn't really sound professional, but it
got the job done. (And, of course, final recordings were done later based
on the rough-sketch demos.)

<h3>MIDI-Only Interfaces</h3>

<p>
MIDI tracks contain no audio, just information that tells a MIDI-compatible
audio device what notes to play. In the somewhat older days, we used MIDI
tracks to control physical synthesizers, which in turn still needed to be
recorded via an audio input. But today, there are lots of excellent
software synthesizers that you can control with MIDI. For instrumental
keyboard-driven music, this may totally eliminate the need for a digital
audio interface, and you can get by with a less expensive MIDI interface:

<p>
Even amongst MIDI-only interfaces, there is a lot of variety. If
you're connecting a single MIDI keyboard up to your computer to play
software synthesizers, you should be fine with a basic interface like
the <a href="http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/UMOne">Roland
UM-One</a>. If you have multiple keyboards or multiple MIDI
synthesizers you want to control, something like
the <a href="http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/MidiExp128">MOTU
MIDI Express 128</a> might be a better option.

<h2>The Computer Itself</h2>

<p>
You may well already own a computer. Most recent laptop and desktop
computers (maybe not netbooks) should be adequate to begin exploring
music production with, but there are some key components that you may
want to upgrade as you progress. But first...

<h3>Mac or Windows?</h3>

<p>
Either Mac or Windows-based systems should work fine. Most
professional music production software is available for both operating
systems. In my experience, it appears that most professional sound
engineers prefer to use Macs, but there's no reason that you need to
if you're uncomfortable with that option.

<p>
Unfortunately, software vendors have been less kind to Linux. There is
some music production software available that runs on Linux, but
there's a whole lot more that doesn't. As of this writing (early
2012), I really don't see how it makes any practical sense to favor
Linux for music production, unless you have some other compelling
reason to do so.

<h3>Physical Computer Resources</h3>

<p>
Music production software (especially software synthesizers / samplers
and effects) can be very memory intensive. The more memory (RAM) you
can get into your computer, the better. Aim for at least 4GB, though
you can be productive with less. More would be even better.

<p>
Music project data can take up a lot of disk space. Large, fast hard
drives would be good. Large solid-state drives would be even
better. At the moment, solid-state drives are pretty expensive, but
consider using one to store your application software and maybe your
sampled instrument data.

<p>
Some audio applications take advantage of multi-core processors, and
some don't. The future looks to be increasingly multi-core, so you
might as well get as many cores in your processors as you can, though
if you have to pick between beefing up the processor and adding more
memory, right now more memory might be the more useful option.
