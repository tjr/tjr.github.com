<p>
Over the course of a century, the technology for recording music has gone from
complicated, specialized equipment to which few people had access, to fairly
easy-to-use systems that run on computers which many people already own. With
a relatively modest investment, you can have everything you need to start
producing professional-quality music recordings in your home.

<h2>Digital Audio Workstation Software</h2>

<p>
The central piece of the system is the Digital Audio Workstation software,
commonly referred to as the DAW. This is the software that you use for
recording new tracks of audio (or MIDI) data, editing the tracks, applying
effects to the tracks, and mixing the tracks down to a more or less final
output. There are numerous DAW applications to choose from.

<h3>ProTools</h3>

<p>
For
years, <a href="http://www.avid.com/US/products/family/pro-tools">ProTools</a>
has been the professional standard for DAW applications. If you are
absolutely serious about digital music production, this is the way to
go. Other DAW applications may well offer all of the features that you
need, but using ProTools will give you maximum compatibility when
exchanging files with other professional sound engineers.

<p>
It used to be the case that ProTools required special custom hardware
to work with, but the latest versions of ProTools will work with a
variety of modern digital audio interfaces (which we will look at
shortly).

<p>
What if you're not absolutely serious about digital music production?
ProTools carries a high price tag, and if you are just getting
started, it might not make sense to buy ProTools right away. Other DAW
applications will do quite nicely as you learn, and in fact, depending
on how you interact with other studios, you may never feel compelled
to buy ProTools at all.
