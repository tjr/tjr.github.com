<p>
Over the course of a century, the technology for recording music has gone from
complicated, specialized equipment to which few people had access, to fairly
easy-to-use systems that run on computers which many people already own. With
a relatively modest investment, you can have everything you need to start
producing professional-quality music recordings in your home.

<h2>Digital Audio Workstation Software</h2>

<p>
The central piece of the system is the Digital Audio Workstation software,
commonly referred to as the DAW. This is the software that you use for
recording new tracks of audio (or MIDI) data, editing the tracks, applying
effects to the tracks, and mixing the tracks down to a more or less final
output. There are numerous DAW applications to choose from.

<h3>ProTools</h3>

<p>
For
years, <a href="http://www.avid.com/US/products/family/pro-tools">ProTools</a>
has been the professional standard for DAW applications. If you are
absolutely serious about digital music production, this is the way to
go. Other DAW applications may well offer all of the features that you
need, but using ProTools will give you maximum compatibility when
exchanging files with other professional sound engineers.

<p>
It used to be the case that ProTools required special custom hardware
to work with, but the latest versions of ProTools will work with a
variety of modern digital audio interfaces (which we will look at
shortly).

<p>
What if you're not absolutely serious about digital music production?
ProTools carries a high price tag, and if you are just getting
started, it might not make sense to buy ProTools right away. Other DAW
applications will do quite nicely as you learn, and in fact, depending
on how you interact with other studios, you may never feel compelled
to buy ProTools at all.

<h3>Reaper</h3>

<p>
Toward the other end of the cost spectrum is
<a href="http://www.reaper.fm/">Reaper</a>, but the low cost is not
indicative of low quality.

<h3>GarageBand</h3>

<p>
For Apple fans, <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband/">GarageBand</a>
may be a good starting point. It's very easy to use, comes with a variety of
built-in music clips, and includes educational features to help beginners
learn how to play music. It also has some limitations that make it a
suboptimal choice for a serious DAW application. But for compiling song
ideas and generally getting acquainted with the concepts of multi-track
music recording, it may be the most novice-friendly option.

<p>
Also available in
<a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/from-the-app-store/apps-by-apple/garageband.html">iPhone
and iPad editions</a>.


<h3>Others</h3>

<p>
And there's lots more:
<a href="http://www.cakewalk.com/">Cakewalk SONAR</a>,
<a href="http://www.steinberg.net/en/products/cubase/start.html">Steinberg Cubase</a>,
<a href="http://www.mackie.com/products/tracktion3/">Mackie
Tracktion</a>...  To a first approximation, they all do the same basic
things, but have different user interfaces and different features and
built-in add-ons beyond the digital audio workstation core.

<h3>So Which One Should I Use?</h3>

<p>
If you have a Mac, you can start tinkering with GarageBand right now without
paying anything.

<p>
If you don't have a Mac, or are ready to move past GarageBand, then Reaper
may be a high-quality, cost-efficient choice.
If you have the money to spend and time to learn, you might as well start with
ProTools.

<p>
But before you run out and buy a DAW application, you might find that some
DAW software comes bundled with whatever digital audio interface that you
buy...

<h2>Digital Audio Interfaces</h2>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/trothwell/6809975837/" title="IMG_7107 by trothwell, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7023/6809975837_9db88001b7_m.jpg" width="160" height="240" alt="IMG_7107" align="right" class="photo"></a>

<p>
In order to get audio into your computer, you have to have some sort
of interface hardware that converts analog audio signals into digital
data.

<h3>Built-In Microphone Input</h3>

<p>
Most modern computers have either a built-in microphone, or a built-in
1/8-inch microphone input jack, or both. This will probably be insufficient
for doing much serious work, but it can be enough to get started with.
Consider, for example, the
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1G-zwuQvEk">song demo recordings</a>
for <i>Phineas and Ferb</i>, which were recorded straight into the built-in
microphone on the computer. It doesn't really sound professional, but it
got the job done. (And, of course, final recordings were done later based
on the rough-sketch demos.)

<h3>USB/Firewire Audio Interfaces</h3>

<p>
What you will probably want to get is some sort of digital audio interface
that connects to your computer via USB or Firewire, preferably supporting
the fastest of these connections that your computer can handle (e.g., USB 2
rather than USB 1, or Firewire 800 rather than Firewire 400).

<p>
The digital audio interface itself is some sort of electronics box, that
accepts one or more analog audio inputs and converts the audio signal into
digital data that flows into the computer via a USB or Firewire connection.
There is a wide variety of different audio interfaces, and which kind you
should get depends on what you need to do with it.

<p>
The <a href="http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/FastTrackPro">M-Audio
FastTrack Pro</a>, for example, has only two audio inputs. If you are
recording things like vocals, or guitar, or a stereo keyboard, one
instrument (or at most two) at a time, and don't mind plugging in and
unplugging input cables as needed, then this sort of interface could
work fine.

<p>
For recording several instruments simultaneously, or if you
want to plug in multiple instruments and leave them plugged in, then
something like
the <a href="http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/UltraLite3Hy">MOTU
UltraLite</a> may be in order. This offers a total of ten input
tracks, including two microphone inputs (which can double as 1/4-inch
line inputs) and eight 1/4-inch line inputs.

<p>
If you're planning on getting into ProTools, one cost-effective plan
is to select a digital audio interface that comes bundled with the
ProTools software, such as
the <a href="http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/PTMboxProPT9">Avid
Mbox Pro</a>.

<p>
Many, but not all, digital audio interfaces also include a MIDI interface
for relaying MIDI input from keyboards and other instruments into the
computer. If you plan on using MIDI input, you might want to make sure
MIDI connections are included on your audio interface, or you could get
a standalone MIDI interface.

<h3>MIDI-Only Interfaces</h3>

<p>
MIDI tracks contain no audio, just information that tells a MIDI-compatible
audio device what notes to play. In the somewhat older days, we used MIDI
tracks to control physical synthesizers, which in turn still needed to be
recorded via an audio input. But today, there are lots of excellent
software synthesizers that you can control with MIDI. For instrumental
keyboard-driven music, this may totally eliminate the need for a digital
audio interface, and you can get by with a less expensive MIDI interface:

<p>
Even amongst MIDI-only interfaces, there is a lot of variety. If
you're connecting a single MIDI keyboard up to your computer to play
software synthesizers, you should be fine with a basic interface like
the <a href="http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/UMOne">Roland
UM-One</a>. If you have multiple keyboards or multiple MIDI
synthesizers you want to control, something like
the <a href="http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/MidiExp128">MOTU
MIDI Express 128</a> might be a better option.

<h2>Cables, Cables, Cables</h2>

<p>
You will also need cables to connect all of your equipment together. Many
computer devices (like your digital audio interface) will come with at
least enough cabling to attach to the computer, but you'll need to make
sure you have enough for all of your connections, and it's a good idea
to keep some spare cables around in case any of them go bad during use
or get lost.

<p>
What kind of cable to get? If you're reasonably gentle with them, it
may work just fine to get whatever the least expensive option is. For
cables that get jostled around a lot (like a guitar cable), it's better
to get something more robust that can handle wear &amp; tear.

<p>
When possible, connecting two devices using the shortest length of
cable that can safely and comfortable work will ultimately help reduce
clutter. It can get messy fast if you're using 20-foot cables to connect
a bunch of devices that are all within six feet of each other.

<h2>The Computer Itself</h2>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/trothwell/6809978829/" title="IMG_7114 by trothwell, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7011/6809978829_4f140821c3_m.jpg" width="160" height="240" alt="IMG_7114" align="right" class="photo"></a>

<p>
You may well already own a computer. Most recent laptop and desktop
computers (maybe not netbooks) should be adequate to begin exploring
music production with, though there are some key components that you may
want to upgrade as you progress. But first...

<h3>Mac or Windows?</h3>

<p>
Either Mac or Windows-based systems should work fine. Most
professional music production software is available for both operating
systems. In my experience, it appears that most professional sound
engineers prefer to use Macs, but there's no reason that you need to
if you're uncomfortable with that option.

<p>
Unfortunately, software vendors have been less kind to Linux. There is
some music production software available that runs on Linux, but
there's a whole lot more that doesn't. As of this writing (early
2012), I really don't see how it makes any practical sense to favor
Linux for music production, unless you have some other compelling
reason to do so.

<h3>Physical Computer Resources</h3>

<p>
Music production software (especially software synthesizers / samplers
and effects) can be very memory intensive. The more memory (RAM) you
can get into your computer, the better. Aim for at least 4GB, though
you can be productive with less. More would be even better.

<p>
Music project data can take up a lot of disk space. Large, fast hard
drives would be good. Large solid-state drives would be even
better. At the moment, solid-state drives are pretty expensive, but
consider using one to store your application software and maybe your
sampled instrument data.

<p>
Some audio applications take advantage of multi-core processors, and
some don't. The future looks to be increasingly multi-core, so you
might as well get as many cores in your processors as you can, though
if you have to pick between beefing up the processor and adding more
memory, right now more memory might be the more useful option.
