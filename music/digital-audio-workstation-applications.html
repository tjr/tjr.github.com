<p>
I had heard that my digital audio workstation software of many years,
<a href="http://www.mackie.com/products/tracktion3/">Mackie Tracktion</a>,
did not work under Mac OS X 10.7, so I had refrained from upgrading to 10.7
until I figured out a replacement solution. I cheerfully accepted the
upgrade from OS X 10.6.7 to 10.6.8, and discovered that Tracktion was
rendered partially broken...  so it seemed like a good time to survey
the current world of DAW applications.

<h2>Pro Tools</h2>

<a href="http://www.avid.com/US/products/family/pro-tools">Avid Pro
Tools</a> is the most professional option, if for no other reason then
because most professional recording engineers use Pro Tools.  It's usually
reasonably straightforward to work with other people across DAW applications
(you can export and import raw audio files), but it's easiest if you can
seamlessly share all of the project data. If you expect to work with other
studios and want maximum compatibility, you probably want Pro Tools.

<p>
Even if compatibility isn't a concern, Pro Tools is a heavy-duty piece
of software, with lots of high-end features and included effects.

<p>
There was a time when Pro Tools could only run with special audio
hardware, but the latest version of Pro Tools supports any modern
digital audio interface, with a somewhat limited feature set. You
can also still buy the Pro Tools-specific audio hardware and gain
access to every feature Pro Tools offers.

<h2>Ableton Live</h2>

<a href="http://www.ableton.com/live">Ableton Live</a> is pretty unique.
The interface is geared toward sequencing and tracking music section by
section before working on the song as a whole, and includes features
useful for incorporating recorded music into live music performance. My
first introduction to multitrack recording came on the old
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensoniq">Ensoniq</a> sequencers,
and I've not seen anything in the modern recording world that is closer
to how the Ensoniq machines functioned than Ableton Live.


<h2>Reason</h2>

<a href="http://www.propellerheads.se/products/reason/">Propellerhead
Reason</a> just recently added audio recording to their software, bringing
it to full DAW status. It's distinguishing factor is the user interface,
which mimics a physical rack of studio equipment.

<p>
As a software engineer, I notice that often it's better not to try
to recreate physical interface experiences on computers. But if that's
what you're used to, Reason may help make an easier transition from
electronic studio gear to software recording.

<p>
Comes with a variety of virtual instruments and effects, biased toward
synth/techno stylings.

<h2>Reaper</h2>

<a href="http://www.reaper.fm/">Reaper</a> is inexpensive. Sometimes
that suggests poor quality, but in this case it seems to suggest a 
good deal. Reaper isn't as reknowned as some of the other packages,
but it works well. The interface is a little puzzling at first, but
after an hour or two of tinkering around it becomes sufficiently
easy to use.

<p>
A good variety of effects is included.

<h2>What About Tracktion?</h2>

It appears to me that development of Mackie Tracktion is basically
dead, and has been for years. If you happen to come across a good deal
on a copy of it, and if it works on your computer system, it may well
be a fine thing to have. It served me well for a long time. But it has
bugs that will probably never be fixed, and it will increasingly lack
modern features available elsewhere.

<h2>How to Make a Choice?</h2>

As far as basic DAW functionality, most of the options do more or less
the same thing, with Ableton Live offering some additional sectional
sequencing.  If you have no specific needs, you might as well pick the
least expensive option, or go with whatever DAW software may come with
your digital audio interface.

<p>
If cost is no concern, you will be less likely to have problems with
Pro Tools than anything else. Since most professional recording
engineers use it, it will be easily compatible with lots of studios,
and there should be no shortage of people who can help and third-party
software, hardware, and documentation that is known to support Pro
Tools.

<h2>What About Me?</h2>

Since losing fully-functional Tracktion, I've been using Reaper. I
eventually want to migrate to Pro Tools, but don't want to spend the
money on that right now, and Reaper is a pretty nice upgrade over what
Tracktion offered. Specifically, for example, Reaper can easily split
out MIDI drum parts into individual tracks for each drum for easy
mixing, force virtual instrument tracks to render in real time (useful
for memory-intenseive instruments), and it so far seems less inclined
to crash than Tracktion...
