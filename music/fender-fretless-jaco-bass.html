<h1>Fender "Jaco Pastorious" Fretless Bass</h1>
<p>a product review by <a href="/">Trevis Rothwell</a>

<hr>

<p>
Jaco Pastorious was a bassist with groundbreaking style and technique,
best known for playing a fretless Fender Jazz bass. Jaco's bass was
originally a standard-issue 1962 fretted Fender Jazz bass that, according
to Jaco, he personally removed the frets from, or, also according to Jaco,
he bought used already defretted.

<p>
In honor of Jaco's infamous stylings, Fender currently makes two different
fretless basses:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.fender.com/basses/jazz-bass/jaco-pastorius-jazz-bass/">Jaco Pastorious Jazz Bass</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.fender.com/basses/jazz-bass/jaco-pastorius-tribute-jazz-bass/">Jaco Pastorious Tribute Jazz Bass</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
What are the differences? To a first approximation: the Tribute bass,
like Jaco's original, has a coating of epoxy resin on the fingerboard;
the Tribute bass has been pre-distressed to look kinda sorta like
Jaco's bass after his years of maintaining it in less than pristine
condition; the Tribute bass has a suggested retail price of about
twice as much.

<p>
This review is not about the Tribute bass.

<h2>1962 Reissue Jazz Bass</h2>

<p>
Aiming for a faithful recreation of what Jaco's fretless might have
been like when it was brand new, this bass is essentially a "reissue"
of the 1962 Fender Jazz bass. Before Fender moved out of their old
facilities in Fullerton, California, they still had all of the
original assembly tools they used in 1962 and could more authentically
do a 1962 reissue; today's reissues are in spirit and in design rather
than in pure authenticity.

<p>
In any case, some of the reissue-specific features include:

<ul>
<li>Reverse turners: turn the opposite way to tighten / loosen strings.</li>
<li>Vintage-style pickups.</li>
<li>1960's placement of the bridge pickup: slightly further away from the bridge than modern designs.</li>
<li>Smaller fingerboard radius than modern designs.</li>
<li>Standard vintage-style bridge (modern designs include a string-through-body option).</li>
<li>Truss rod not readily adjustable without removing the neck.</li>
<li>Includes chrome pickup covers (not attached by default).</li>
<li>Nitrocellulose lacquer finish: more easily damaged and more prone
to wear than modern polyurethane finishes, but some players prefer the
"worn nitro" look.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Most of these variations I either like or have no particular preference
about. I do wish the truss rod was more easily accessible, but I don't
often need to make adjusments, so it's not a big deal for me. If you
adjust your truss rod a lot, this is worth considering.

<p>
Be especially careful about the nitro finish if you are moving the
bass from a cold environment to a warm one, or vice-versa, for example
bringing the bass inside after leaving it in your car during the
winter.  If you open the case immediately, the sudden change in
temperature could cause surprisingly fast damage to the finish. Better
to let it sit and acclimate to the temperature for a while.

<h2>Compared to Jaco's Bass</h2>

<p>
A real 1962 Fender Jazz bass had two stacked knobs for volume and
tone, one for each of the pickups. Jaco modified his bass to be like
later Fender Jazz basses, with two volume knobs (one for each of the
pickups) and one tone knob (which affects both pickups). This bass
copies Jaco's modifications, right down to using the metal Precision
bass-style knobs rather than the plastic Jazz bass-style.

<p>
Jaco favored using Rotosound steel roundwound strings, pretty high
up on the scale of hard bass strings that can damage a fretless
fingerboard. To counter this, he applied a coating of epoxy resin
to his fingerboard. For this bass, Fender did not go that far, coating
it with urethane rather than epoxy resin. (Note that the Jaco Tribute
bass does use epoxy resin.)

<p>
The original 1962 bass had a rosewood fingerboard. This bass has
a fingerboard made of pao ferro wood, which is a somewhat stronger
(denser) variant of rosewood, sometimes referred to as "ironwood".


<h2>Carrying Case</h2>

<p>
The bass comes with a vintage-looking 1960's style hardshell case made
by the <a href="http://www.ggqualitycase.com/">G&amp;G Quality Case
Company</a>.

<h2>Strings</h2>

<p>
On fretted basses, the string does not typically quite touch the
wooden fingerboard, but on fretless basses, the kind of string used
can make a difference in how much and how quickly the wood gets worn
down by the strings. All other things being equal, roundwound strings
will wear down a fingerboard faster than flatwound strings; steel
roundwound strings will do so faster than nickel roundwound strings.

<p>
Some people prefer to use only flatwound strings to help preserve the
life of the fingerboard. Others prefer to use whatever string gets the
sound and feel they most prefer, even if it means additional
maintenance on the instrument.

<p>
This bass comes stocked with Fender flatwound strings. On mine, these
strings were unusably bad: high friction that ripped some skin off my
finger, and inexplicably poor intonation. I can only suppose that the
bass had been played a lot, perhaps demoed sitting in the store. I doubt
that Fender flatwound strings are usually that awful.

<p>
I replaced them first with a set
of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/DAddario-ENR71-Guitar-Strings-Regular/dp/B0009FZWMW">D'Addario
Half Rounds</a>, which sport a round-wound interior and a simulated
flat-wound exterior. Supposedly these are brighter than plain
flatwound strings, but after a while I wasn't quite digging the sound.

<p>
I next put on a set
of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/DAddario-ECB81-Chromes-Guitar-Strings/dp/B000OR2QX8/">D'Addario
Chromes</a>, standard flatwound strings. These had a pretty decent
sound, but again after some time I felt I could coax a better tone out
of the bass with difference strings.

<p>
Most recently, I ignored the common wisdom of favoring flat-ish
strings and installed a set
of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/DR-Strings-Sunbeam-Nickel-Plated/dp/B0002FO8E2/">DR
Sunbeams</a>, a nickel roundwound string that is reputed to be
somewhat kinder to a fretless fingerboard than most roundwound
strings. These definitely offer a brighter, punchier tone than the
flatwounds, which is not surprising. What I did find surprising was
that it seemed easier to maintain correct intonation with these
strings: I could be a little sloppy and it wasn't as noticeable as it
was with the flatwound strings.

<p>
You could ask a hundred people what strings are best on a fretless
bass and get a hundred answers, divided approximately half and half
into sundry flatwound strings and various roundwound strings. It takes
research and experimentation to find what you personally like best on
the Fender Jaco bass, just as it does on any bass.


<h2>Year of Manufacture</h2>

<p>
Debatably, Fender has gone through some quality control rough spots,
with some consensus that they significantly improved their act in
2008. My copy of the instrument was built in 2012.


<h2>Other Options</h2>

<p>
For most intents and purposes, the Fender Jaco bass
(<a href="http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/JBassJP3SB/">$1800 at
Sweetwater</a>) is pretty similar to the American Standard Fender
fretless jazz bass
(<a href="http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/JBassFL3SB2/">$1350
at Sweetwater</a>). I purchased mine for a little less than the
American Standard price. Getting such a good deal was the only reason
I selected it; I would have bought the American Standard
otherwise. The 1962-reissue features are (mostly) nice, but in my
opinion not worth an extra $450.

<p>
You could also consider a Mexican-made Standard Fender fretless bass
(<a href="http://www.guitarcenter.com/Fender-Standard-Fretless-Jazz-Bass-Guitar-H76504-i2026046.gc">$600
at Guitar Center</a>). I've not played (or encountered) one of these
for some years, but I have heard that Fender's Mexican production
quality has increased in tandem with their American production
quality.
