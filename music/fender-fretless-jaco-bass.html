<h1>Fender "Jaco Pastorious" Fretless Bass</h1>
<p>
<a href="/">Home</a> : <a href="/music/">Music</a> : a product review by Trevis Rothwell, last updated February 2013

<hr>

<p>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaco_Pastorius">Jaco
Pastorious</a> was a bassist with groundbreaking style and technique,
best known for playing a fretless Fender Jazz bass. Jaco's bass was
originally a standard-issue 1962 fretted Fender Jazz bass that,
according to Jaco, he personally removed the frets from, or, also
according to Jaco, he bought used already defretted.

<p>(Fender did not
start selling fretless basses until the 1970's; their rise to the
top in the low end of bass guitars was mostly attributed to the
success of their "precision" bass, so-called because it had frets,
and thus it was easier to play precisely in-tune than on fretless
upright basses.)

<p>
In honor of Jaco's infamous stylings, Fender currently makes two different
fretless basses:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.fender.com/basses/jazz-bass/jaco-pastorius-jazz-bass/">Jaco Pastorious Jazz Bass</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.fender.com/basses/jazz-bass/jaco-pastorius-tribute-jazz-bass/">Jaco Pastorious Tribute Jazz Bass</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
What are the differences? To a first approximation: the Tribute bass,
like Jaco's original, has a coating of epoxy resin on the fingerboard;
the Tribute bass has been pre-distressed to look kinda sorta like
Jaco's bass after his years of maintaining it in less than pristine
condition; the Tribute bass has a suggested retail price of about
twice as much.

<p>
This review is not about the Tribute bass.

<h2>1962 Reissue Jazz Bass</h2>

<p>
Aiming for a faithful recreation of what Jaco's fretless might have
been like when it was brand new, this bass is essentially a "reissue"
of the 1962 Fender Jazz bass. Before Fender moved out of their old
facilities in Fullerton, California, they still had all of the
original assembly tools they used in 1962 and could more authentically
do a 1962 reissue; today's reissues are in spirit and in design rather
than in pure authenticity.

<p>
In any case, some of the reissue-specific features include:

<ul>
<li>Reverse turners: turn the opposite way to tighten / loosen strings.</li>
<li>Vintage-style pickups.</li>
<li>1960's placement of the bridge pickup: slightly further away from the bridge than modern designs.</li>
<li>Smaller fingerboard radius than modern designs.</li>
<li>Standard vintage-style bridge (modern designs include a string-through-body option).</li>
<li>Truss rod not readily adjustable without removing the neck.</li>
<li>Includes chrome pickup covers (not attached by default).</li>
<li>Nitrocellulose lacquer finish: more easily damaged and more prone
to wear than modern polyurethane finishes, but some players prefer the
"worn nitro" look.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Most of these variations I either like or have no particular preference
about. I do wish the truss rod was more easily accessible, but I don't
often need to make adjusments, so it's not a big deal for me. If you
adjust your truss rod a lot, this is worth considering.

<p>
Be especially careful about the nitro finish if you are moving the
bass from a cold environment to a warm one, or vice-versa, for example
bringing the bass inside after leaving it in your car during the
winter.  If you open the case immediately, the sudden change in
temperature could cause surprisingly fast damage to the finish. Better
to let it sit and acclimate to the temperature for a while.

<h2>Compared to Jaco's Bass</h2>

<p>
A real 1962 Fender Jazz bass had two stacked knobs for volume and
tone, one for each of the pickups. Jaco modified his bass to be like
later Fender Jazz basses, with two volume knobs (one for each of the
pickups) and one tone knob (which affects both pickups). This bass
copies Jaco's modifications, right down to using the metal Precision
bass-style knobs rather than the plastic Jazz bass-style.

<p>
Jaco favored using Rotosound steel roundwound strings, pretty high up
on the scale of hard bass strings that can damage a fretless
fingerboard. To counter this, he applied a coating of epoxy resin to
his fingerboard. For this bass, Fender did not go that far, coating it
with urethane rather than epoxy resin. If you really wanted the epoxy
resin, you could have a luthier coat the fingerboard with epoxy for
you, or, in a well-ventilated area and with some patience, do it
yourself.

<p>
The original 1962 bass had a rosewood fingerboard. This bass has
a fingerboard made of pao ferro wood, which is a somewhat stronger
(denser) variant of rosewood, sometimes referred to as "ironwood".

<p>
This bass sports a "Jaco" signature neck plate on the back. If you're
not really into "signature" instruments, you can easily replace this
with a standard Fender bass neck plate.

<h2>Carrying Case</h2>

<p>
The bass comes with a vintage-looking 1960's style hardshell case made
by the <a href="http://www.ggqualitycase.com/">G&amp;G Quality Case
Company</a>.

<h2>Strings</h2>

<p>
On fretted basses, the string does not typically quite touch the
wooden fingerboard, as it comes in contact with the metal frets. But
on fretless basses, the string is pressed directly against the
wood. The kind of string used can make a difference in how much and
how quickly the wood gets worn down by the strings. All other things
being equal, roundwound strings will wear down a fingerboard faster
than flatwound strings; steel roundwound strings will do so faster
than nickel roundwound strings.

<p>
Some people prefer to use only flatwound strings to help preserve the
life of the fingerboard. Others prefer to use whatever string gets the
sound and feel they most prefer, even if it means additional
maintenance on the instrument.

<p>
This bass comes stocked with Fender flatwound strings. On mine, these
strings were unusably bad: high friction that ripped some skin off my
finger, and inexplicably poor intonation. I can only suppose that the
bass had been played a lot, perhaps demoed sitting in the store. I doubt
that Fender flatwound strings are usually that awful.

<p>
Choice of strings can have a major impact in how the instrument sounds.
Over the course of several months, I tried:
<ul>

<li>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/DAddario-ECB81-Chromes-Guitar-Strings/dp/B000OR2QX8/">D'Addario
Chromes</a>, standard flatwound strings. These have a pretty decent
tone, but nowhere near as good as the Thomastik-Infield flatwound strings.
(I have not put Thomastiks on this particular bass yet, but if
you want straight up flatwound strings, they are an excellent choice.)
</li>

<li>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/DAddario-ENR71-Guitar-Strings-Regular/dp/B0009FZWMW">D'Addario
Half Rounds</a>, which sport a round-wound interior and a simulated
flat-wound exterior. These are slightly brighter in tone than flatwound
strings.
</li>

<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/DR-Strings-Sunbeam-Nickel-Plated/dp/B0002FO8E2/">DR
Sunbeams</a>, a nickel roundwound string that is reputed to be
somewhat kinder to a fretless fingerboard than most roundwound
strings. These definitely offer a brighter, punchier tone than the
flatwounds, but also somehow made the fretless bass sound...  less
fretless.</li>

<li>
<a href="http://www.juststrings.com/labellaelectricbassguitarblacknylon.html">La
Bella Black Nylon Tape Wound</a> strings, a steel roundwound string
literally wrapped with nylon tape. These offer a somewhat
upright-bass-like tone, with the underlying steel roundwound string
giving some zing and the tape exterior rendering the string flat as
far as the fingerboard is concerned.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
These all had good qualities to them, but for my tastes I am presently
keeping the tapewound strings on the bass.

<p>
You could ask a hundred people what strings are best on a fretless
bass and get a hundred answers, divided approximately half and half
into sundry flatwound strings and various roundwound strings. It takes
research and experimentation to find what you personally like best on
the Fender Jaco bass, just as it does on any bass.


<h2>Year of Manufacture</h2>

<p>
Debatably, Fender has gone through some quality control rough spots,
with some consensus that they significantly improved their act in
2008. My copy of the instrument was built in 2012.


<h2>Other Options</h2>

<p>
For most intents and purposes, the Fender Jaco bass
(<a href="http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/JBassJP3SB/">$1800 at
Sweetwater</a>) is pretty similar to the American Standard Fender
fretless jazz bass
(<a href="http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/JBassFL3SB2/">$1350
at Sweetwater</a>). I purchased mine for less than the American
Standard price. Getting such a good deal was the only reason I
selected it; I would have bought the American Standard otherwise. The
1962-reissue features are (mostly) nice, but in my opinion not worth
an extra $450. (If you buy from Sweetwater, consider asking for Jeff
Barnett when you place your order; Jeff has been a helpful "sales
engineer" for many years.)

<p>
You could also consider a Mexican-made Standard Fender fretless bass
(<a href="http://www.guitarcenter.com/Fender-Standard-Fretless-Jazz-Bass-Guitar-H76504-i2026046.gc">$600
at Guitar Center</a>). I've not played (or encountered) one of these
for some years, but I have heard that Fender's Mexican production
quality has increased in tandem with their American production
quality.

<p>
And for the Jaco purists, you could buy a fretted Fender Jazz bass,
rip the frets out with your bare hands, fill in the gaps with wood
glue, eat a bucket of fried chicken, play the bass once (without
washing the chicken grease off your hands) and then toss it in the
ocean!
