<h3>Atmosphere Control Productions</h3>

<p>
I co-founded this <a href="http://www.atmospherecontrolmusic.com/">music production company</a>, primarily as an outlet for creating and releasing musical recordings. We also do production and session work for hire. Through our projects, I have had the opportunity to work with many great musicians, including Abraham Laboriel, Bill Maxwell, Justo Almario, and Tom Brooks.

<h3>Church Music Resources</h3>

Written principally for use at my own church, but may well be useful in other similar situations.
