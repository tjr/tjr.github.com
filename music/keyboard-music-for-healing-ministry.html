    <h2>Keyboard Music for Healing Ministry</h2>

Much more than playing songs for worship sets, playing music to accompany times of healing ministry (as well as times of prayer and other forms of ministry) is very open to perceiving how the service is going, and making decisions and changes in the music as you play. Everyone brings their own experience to the table, and I would not expect you to play this sort of music exactly like I do.

<p>
That said, here are some tips and suggestions from what I have learned...

<h3>Basic Chord Progressions</h3>

<p>
If you're not sure what to do but need to get going, playing a I-IV chord progression is a good way to start. In fact, there's a whole lot you can do just basing your music off of the I-IV progression: you can add a 2nd to the chords, you can add a major 7th, or turn them into major 7 (add 9) chords.  You can play steady block chords on quarter notes, or maybe play majestic 16th-note runs of broken chords, or bring it down real low with some whole notes.  There's lots and lots of options, and which to use is a matter of judgement based on how the service is going.  Here's a sample of the variety you can get just basing things on a I-IV progression (played in the key of C here):

<p>
Sometimes you may feel that you need a little more movement in the chord progression. One route is to enhance the I-IV progression by turning it into a I-ii-I/iii-IV progression. You can easily replace the I/iii chord with a straight iii chord if the situation warrants it, though most of the time I find that the major sound of the I/iii (just an inverted I chord) is more to my liking.

<p>
Another chord progression is what I think of as the "Penny Lane" progression, because I first learned it years ago listening to the Beatles song by that name. This series of chords is used in lots and lots of songs.  One basic alteration is to play it with either a minor ii chord, or with a major II chord.  They both sound good, but lend an overall different flavor.  <a href="http://diministries.org/">Pastor David Ingles</a> played for years for Kenneth Hagin, and he often used the major II chord in this sort of situation.

<h3>Free-form, Sounds from Heaven</h3>

<p>
As you really get into the spirit and flow of the service, it becomes easier to draw on sounds out of your heart. It seems to me that there are not only different places in the spirit realm and different anointings for services, but there are also different sounds to accompany these. Perhaps I can state it best by saying you can use the instruments to paint musical pictures of what's going on in the spirit.  There may not be a very definite chord progression all the time; the rhythms and tempo may change frequently.  This sort of playing is much harder to do with more than one musician, simply because everyone playing has to be so very in-tune with what's going on.

<p>
Here's an example of the style of playing; I just recorded this at home, not during a service, but you can still get an idea for how this sort of music might come about:

<ul>
<li><a href="/mp3/keyboard-samples/meandering.mp3">Sample of free-form playing</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
A similar concept is on Phil Driscoll's album "Selah"; a collection of improvised music recorded based on passages in the scriptures.

<h3>Actual Songs</h3>

<p>
Sometimes it may be fitting to play an pre-composed song, but be very open to playing it loosely and making changes to flow with the service. 
What song to use? I have my own catalog of songs that I would generally pick from, and it'd be good for you to have your own. Memorize a few so you can have them at the ready whenever it's approprite.  Here are some samples:

<ul>
<li><a href="/mp3/keyboard-samples/hil.mp3">He Is Lord</a></li>
<li><a href="/mp3/keyboard-samples/bsol.mp3">Believing Side of Life</a></li>
<li><a href="/mp3/keyboard-samples/intheriver.mp3">I'm in the River of the Sweet Holy Ghost</a> (good for moderately up-tempo usage)</li>
</ul>

<p>
There are many, many possibilities.  A hymnal might be a good place to start looking for more ideas.  I have a couple of them, one very old (purchased from an antique book dealer) and another very new (purchased at a local Christian bookstore).

<h3>Sound Selection</h3>

<p>
Generally, piano with some amount of strings mixed in is a good idea.  The piano adds a percussiveness and distinction to the notes played, and the strings provide a filler pad to keep the sound reasonably constant.  Consider how white noise machines are used: they help to block random distracting noises. Likewise, keeping the sound going constantly can help to mask the sounds of people moving, chairs moving, etc.  Of course, it's also just a great sound in and of itself, but it does offer some practical benefit as well.

<p>
There may be times you want to play only the strings; there may be times you want to play only the piano. There may be times you want to swap the piano for an electric piano or acoustic guitar sound, or swap the strings for a choir sound, or a more synthetic pad sound. This is where it comes in handy to be very familiar with the keyboard you are playing, and to have it programmed such that the sounds you are likely to use are easily accessible.

<h3>Keys</h3>

<p>
Different keys sound, well, different. You might find some keys have a more pleasant, agreeable sound for the ministry time than others (and it might not always be the same). Then again, you might not notice any difference.  I personally like the key of F for ministry time a lot, but it depends on the situation.

<p>
I find that, starting with the key of C, you can add flats through the keys of F, Bb, and Eb, and the sound tends to get increasingly mellow and smooth. Once you get to Ab, that adds a Db to the key signature, which is the same pitch as C#.  C# and F# tend to sound bright to me, hence the keys G, D, A tend to have a brighter sound. Likewise, the Db/C# in the key of Ab starts to kind of ruin the mellowness of it.  Past four accidentals in the key signature, the bright/mellow tones start mixing, and get harder to describe for me. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but I don't always know how best to use such keys.

Your experience and perception may vary.

<h3>General Advice</h3>

<ul>
<li>Be alert to the music when you're at a service where you are not playing (e.g., at the Dufresne's church, or at Rhema; you can listen online). Is it good? Is it bad? Is it flowing well, and enabling the ministry? If so, why? If not, why not? Take note of songs and arrangements used, and how you thought they added to or hindered the service.  Of course, major meetings by well-known ministers will rarely have bad music, so you'll mostly be cataloging good ideas. (Although, once I was in a service with Dr. T.L. Osborn. The music really wasn't that great. After the music, Dr. Osborn appeared on the platform, and <i>as soon as he began to speak</i>, the atmosphere was charged with the presence of God in a way that I have very rarely experienced. So even mediocre music doesn't necessarily ruin the service....  not that this is our goal....  :-)</li>

<br>

<li>Listen to good music frequently. Suggestions: <a href="http://www.mightyhorn.com/">Phil Driscoll</a>, David Ellis, <a href="http://diministries.org/">David Ingles</a>, <a href="http://archiveserver.morelifenow.org/music/index.php">Keith Moore</a>, <a href="http://www.biggodmedia.com/">Joel Siegel</a>, music released by <a href="http://www.rhema.org/">Rhema / Kenneth Hagin Ministries</a>, music released by <a href="http://www.kcm.org/">Kenneth Copeland Ministries</a>, music released by <a href="http://www.lwcc.org/">Living Word Christian Center</a>, Wayne Stevens, <a href="http://www.raygenewilson.com/">RayGene Wilson</a>, <a href="http://www.lenmink.com/">Len Mink</a>. Also, less obviously, J.S. Bach. He wrote a lot of his music inspired by the scriptures, and basically laid the framework for chord progressions as we know them today.</li>

<br>

<li>Study the Bible as it pertains to music and sounds. There are a lot more references to music than you might think, if you've never looked before. Hint: don't just look up "music", but also "harp", "trumpet", etc.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Bottom Line</h3>

<p>
These ideas are things that work for me. God may have something different for you... a different way of playing, different chord progressions, different style, different people you ought to be listening to for ideas. Seek His wisdom on all of this.  And don't get dismayed if the pastors ask you to change something; I have found that not everything that I like in music do they like, and vice-versa. That's cool; God made us all different. But my job at church is to support the pastors' ministry, and sometimes that means not doing some things that I like, and doing other things that I don't like. But God has wisdom for figuring that out too.
