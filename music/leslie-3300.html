<h1>Leslie 3300</h1>
<p>by <a href="/">Trevis Rothwell</a>

<p>
The digital Leslie simulator built in to the Hammond XK3c is very
good, but if you really want to maximize the sound of the XK3c, you
need to run it through a real Leslie speaker.  The most common choice
of Leslie speaker today is the currently-in-production Leslie 3300.

<h2>What Is a Leslie Speaker?</h2>

<p>
A Leslie speaker is a so-called rotary speaker. It actually consists of
two speakers, an upper speaker for mid- and high-range sounds, and a
lower speaker for bass sounds. Each of these speakers blasts into sort of
sonic funnels that are attached to motors which spin them around in
opposite directions.

<p>
Trying to describe it with words, it hardly seems to make any sense
why anyone would want to do this, sort of like looking at a cow and
concluding that it would taste good as part of a taco. But the
resulting sound has become a highly desireable effect for the Hammond
organ.

<h2>An Ultimately Good Shopping Experience</h2>

<p>
A brand new Leslie 3300 runs about $2500 USD. I ordered a used one from
<a href="http://www.music123.com/">Music123</a> for just over $1800
and had it shipped to a UPS representative retail office so that I
didn't have to wait around at home all afternoon to sign for the
package.

<p>
The Leslie 3300 is not the largest of the Leslie speakers, but it's
pretty big nevertheless: a good 32 inches high, and around 115 pounds
in weight. My home music area is in the basement (the stairs leading
into which is why I preferred the Hammond XK3C over a classic B3 or
C3), and I was absolutely delighted to get it transported home and set
up.

<p>
Unfortunately, things weren't quite right. The upper rotor on the
cabinet was spinning fine, but the lower rotor was not. It was most
likely that the rotor belt came dislodged during shipping, I presumed
as I unscrewed the back panel to fix it.

<p>
I nearly cried when I realized the actual reason the lower rotor was
not spinning: the lower rotor motor was completely absent! Someone had
evidently removed it at some point, or perhaps it was never installed
at the factory in the first place. I have no reason to blame Music123
for this; Leslie speakers are something of an oddity, and they
probably didn't seriously test it before selling it. Nevertheless, I
suspected that, be it to return or take it for repair, I was going to
have to haul the Leslie 3300 back up the stairs and into the car
again.

<p>
But things got better. I called Music123 and explained what happened.
They confirmed that my only option as far as they were concerned was
to return it, but they could sell me a brand new Leslie 3300 at the
significantly discounted price of $1950. I accepted their offer, and
shipped the defunct Leslie back to them.

<h2>How Useful is a Leslie?</h2>

<p>
I have limited experience playing actual old-school Hammond organs;
I've played a bit on a B3, a couple of C3's, and a couple of M3's. But
most of my organ playing has been on a Korg CX3 that I no longer have,
a Hammond XK3C at my church, and most recently a Hammond XK3C of my
own, all sans Leslie speakers. But whenever I have played on an old
Hammond organ with a Leslie, I have been thoroughly impressed with the
sound.

<p>
I should reiterate that the Leslie simulation on the XK3C is very
good. Depending on your organ needs, that may be plenty. If you're
recording the organ and not particularly wanting to feature the organ,
or if you're otherwise happy with the recorded sound of the XK3C
direct, then you probably don't need a Leslie. If you're playing live
and the room would require you to stuff the Leslie behind a sound
barrier and mic it rather than experience the live sound of the Leslie
itself, then it may not be worth it.

<p>
But if you want to feature organ as a predominant instrument in your
recordings, or if you can feature the sound coming out of the Leslie
itself in your live venues, then you will likely benefit from having
the real thing on hand.

<h2>About the Leslie 3300 Itself</h2>

<p>
Unlike the traditional Leslies of yore with their furniture-grade wood
finishes, the wooden cabinet of the 3300 is covered with a black
textured coating and hard rubber corner guards, along with built-in
handles and pre-attached casters, all to make it a much more pleasant
experience to haul it around to gigs than a classic Leslie. That said,
it's still pretty hefty, and you may need a couple of people to lift
it very high (like, into a van).

<p>
It's a couple of inches shorter than the famous Leslie 122, but I am
told by a professional organist that the 3300 sounds almost identical
to the 122, just a bit weaker on the low end... but that's only
noticeable if you're playing the bass pedals in lieu of a bass guitar
in the band. Even then, you can optionally plug the 3300 into an
external subwoofer and get even more low end than the 122 offered.

<p>
The Hammond XK3C hooks up to the 3300 via an 11-pin cable. The 3300
also sports an 8-pin Leslie connector for some slightly older Hammond
keyboards, and a quarter-inch guitar connector, for plugging in all
sorts of other stuff: non-Hammond organs, non-organ synthesizers,
guitars, bass guitars, whatever.

<h2>What Does It Sound Like?</h2>

<p>
The challenge of recording with a Leslie speaker is, well, you have
to mic it. I'm still learning how best to do this, but wanted to share
at least some sort of demo recording (which I will likely replace with
a better demo recording in the future...)

</ul>

<p>
Shure SM59 mic on the upper rotor, MXL V63M mic on the lower rotor,
both through Focusrite ISA preamps into an Echo AudioFire12 A/D
converter. A bit of EQ to reduce excess room noise.
