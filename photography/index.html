<p>I began getting seriously interested in photography in 2005 while taking pictures for
an online community website project. I read articles and discussions at
<a href="http://photo.net/">photo.net</a> voraciously, bought SLR camera equipment like
the wind, and made a point of taking a batch of photos every week or two. After a couple
of years, I became bored with photographing what was around my home, and now mostly only
take pictures when traveling.
