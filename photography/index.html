<p>I began getting seriously interested in photography in 2005 while taking pictures for
an online community website project. I read articles and discussions at
<a href="http://photo.net/">photo.net</a> voraciously, bought SLR camera equipment like
the wind, and made a point of taking a batch of photos every week or two. After a couple
of years, I became bored with photographing what was around my home, and now mostly only
take pictures when traveling.

<h3>My Photographs</h3>
<p>You can see many examples of my photos at:</p>

</ul>
<p>
Long-time fans of my photographic art might notice pictures missing from my Flickr photo sets.
I've so far put most of my previously-published photos onto Flickr, but if you notice anything
absent that you miss, please let me know and I'll try to get it reposted.

<p>
Feel free to use any of my photos on your own personal web pages. (A link back to
www.trevisrothwell.com would be appreciated!) For commercial use, please
<a href="mailto:tjr@acm.org">send me an email first to discuss</a>.

<h3>Selecting a Lens</h3>

<p>
SLR camera manufacturers offer dozens of lenses to choose from, ranging from extreme
wide-angle to extreme telephoto. I found that I am usually most happy with a
standard 50mm/1.4 lens. You might give such a lens a try too.
