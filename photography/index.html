<p>I began getting seriously interested in photography in 2005 while taking pictures for
an online community website project. After a couple of years of intense study and practice,
I became bored with photographing what was around my home, and now mostly take pictures when
traveling or when <a href="/dogs/samantha">Samantha</a> stops running long enough...

<h2>Why Take Photographs?</h2>

<p>
It may be for pure enjoyment, and the specifics of why it is enjoyable may
differ from person to person. I enjoy learning how to use the equipment, and
seeing how different lenses and different camera settings change how the
final image is captured. I enjoy having a catalog of pictures that I can use
to illustrate writings on the web.

<p>
It may be to capture events as historical or personal record. I am glad that
I have some good pictures of my grandmother, and I wish I had taken more
while she was still with us. Pictures taken at special events and while
traveling help us to remember details that we might have otherwise forgotten.
Pictures taken in the same place across a long span of time show us how the
world around us changes, and how it stays the same.

<p>
It may be in the service of others. Taking pictures for weddings and portraits is
a substantial business for many photographers.

<!--
<p>
Basic photography is very pervasive in our culture today. Many people have
cameras built in to their mobile phones, and can easily take pictures and
share them with others. This is a great application of technology, and has
enabled many photographs to be taken that otherwise would not have been.
But in the following sections, we'll be looking at some ideas for moving
beyond phone camera snapshots into more in-depth photographic pursuits.
