    <h2>Audio Limiting</h2>
<p>
some research notes prepared for the SFFC Sound Team by <a href="/">Trevis Rothwell</a>

<h3>Problem Definition</h3>

<p>
The problem we are trying to solve here is that of, SFFC audio
recordings are coming out much too quiet overall, both in an absolute
sense (needing to crank the volume on the car stereo system to
ridiculous levels) and when listened to side-by-side with comparable
recordings from other ministries.

<p>
We want to increase the level of SFFC audio recordings without going
overboard and introducing digital clipping.

<h3>Where Are We At?</h3>

<p>
Here is a graphical representation of a wave file from a recent SFFC
service, prepared using Audacity:

<p>
[First, a few words about what exactly we're seeing. The waveform view
in Audacity shows us the amplitude of the waveform on a scale from 0.0
to +/- 1.0, where 0.0 is silent, and +/- 1.0 is as far away from
silent as the sound can get without clipping.]

<p>
On Audacity's scale, we can see that the majority of the wave hovers
around an amplitude of 0.3 or 0.4, with occasional bursts past
0.5. (The strong wave elements at the beginning and end are the
musical intro/outro tags, which appear to be more solidly around 0.5.)

<h3>Where Do We Want to Go?</h3>

<p>
For comparison, here is a graphical representation of a wave file from
the 2009 ministers' conference hosted by Kenneth Copeland Ministries:

<img src="/images/audio/kcm-audio.jpg" class="audioresearch">

<p>
We see that this audio wave peaks out around 0.9 on the Audacity
scale, and is frequently right up at that peak; the peaks aren't
random bursts, and rarely does the wave drop below 0.5.

<h3>Making Progress</h3>

<p>
I took an approximately two minute clip from the SFFC service above to work with
for generating some samples. First, here is the clip in original form:

<img src="/images/audio/sffc-audio-clip-original.jpg" class="audioresearch">

<p>
(It is more spaced out more horizontally, because we are looking at a shorter
segment of time, but the amplitude is recognizable.)

<h4>Raise the Amplitude and Apply a Limiter</h4>

<p>
Here's the same clip, boosted by approximately 8dB, with a soft limiter applied:

<img src="/images/audio/sffc-audio-clip-with-limiter.jpg" class="audioresearch">

<p>
This looks a lot closer to the KCM audio clip. With some experimentation, we could
determine exactly what decibel boost and limiter settings would give us optimal
results. (I made a few attempts to come up with this sample; a few more would surely
improve it, but I think the idea is clear enough.)

<h4>Just Raise the Amplitude</h4>

<p>
Do we need to bother with a limiter? The original clip was quite low. We could
probably just increase the recording level without introducing a limiter and
see an improvement toward fixing the problem.

<p>
For comparison, here is the clip just boosted by approximately 8dB, with no
limiter:

<img src="/images/audio/sffc-audio-clip-plus8db.jpg" class="audioresearch">

<p>
Definitely an overall strong clip, but there's a lot of variance in
the waveform level, including some high spots that are probably
clipping. So maybe 8dB is too much; we could boost it by 6dB, perhaps,
and get a stronger waveform without clipping. Having the limiter in
place, though, would help us to maximize the level without going too
high.

<h4>What Does It Sound Like?</h4>

<p>
Here's the original sound clip:

<p>
And here's the same clip with an 8dB boost run through a limiter:

<h4>Tools Used</h4>

<p>
For this work, I used Pro Tools 10 to process the audio, specifically
using the standard compressor/limiter plugin that comes with Pro Tools
10. A higher-quality limiter plugin might offer superior results, though
for one track of spoken word audio maybe nothing noticeable.
