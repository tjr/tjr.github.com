My research plan for the indefinite future is to find ways to build
computer systems that can approximate understanding of natural
language. For example, consider:

<ul>
<li>Can a computer read a simple story and understand what happened
in it, say, at the level of a first-grader?</li>
<li>If a computer could understand a simple story, could it also
understand complicated news articles?</li>
<li>Once able to understand complicated news articles, could it read
all available news articles on a given topic and identify gaps in the
story between news outlets? Identify biases between news outlets?</li>
<li>Would natural language translation systems work better if the
computer "understood" and "interpreted" the phrases rather than
executed brute-force word-for-word translation?</li>
</ul>

<p>
Forms of such technology have existed for decades, but there's
still lots of room for progress.

<h2>Knowledge Representation</h2>

<p>
In order for a computer system to be able to compute anything, be it
natural language or any other information, it has to have a formal
model to represent the data. Internal formal models are probably not
involved with how people naturally process information, but we need
them to be able to program anything.

<p>
I suspect that really good data models of semantic information would
be a key to getting computers to do any deep processing of natural
language.
