The goal of research in the natural sciences is to identify something
in nature that presently is either understood poorly or not understood
at all and discover more about how it works. The goal of research in
computer science is to identify something that computer systems
presently either do poorly or cannot do at all and come up with a way
to make them do it. (We claim to already understand existing computer
systems, and don't need to research how they work, though tht claim is
debatable...)

<p>
My research plan for the indefinite future is to find ways to build
computer systems that can approximate understanding of natural
language. For example, consider:

<ul>
<li>Can a computer read a simple story and understand what happened
in it, say, at the level of a first-grader?</li>
<li>If a computer could understand a simple story, could it also
understand complicated news articles?</li>
<li>Once able to understand complicated news articles, could it read
all available news articles on a given topic and identify gaps in the
story between news outlets? Identify biases between news outlets?</li>
<li>Would natural language translation systems work better if the
computer "understood" and "interpreted" the phrases rather than
executed brute-force word-for-word translation?</li>
</ul>

<p>
Researchers have been working on these problems for decades, and
most of the language processing tools that have made their way into
the hands of the general public continue to demonstrate at best a
superficial grasp of what people are actually talking about.

<p>
The bottom line: programming computers to understand natural language
is a tough problem, and there's plenty of worthwhile work left to do.

<h2>Some Ideas</h2>

<p>
...that might be worth investigating...

<ul>
<li>It's fairly straightforward to program a computer system to grasp language
within a particular narrow context. Could we design a way to extend computer
systems with additional interchangable contexts?</li>
<li>Given a strict definition of syntax for a language, it's a simple matter of
programming for a computer system to be able to parse utterances in that language.
The hard part is often dealing with utterances that stray away from entirely-correct
syntax, as lots of real utterances spoken by real people tend to do.</li>
<li>Even the language tools that only superficially process language (like most
language translation systems) are fairly hefty applications that run on servers.
Would it be useful to compact such systems into, say, tiny efficient C programs
that could run directly on mobile devices?</li>
</ul>
