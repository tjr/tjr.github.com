<p>
We use words to convey ideas and concepts. The words themselves have no meaning apart
from the ideas that they are used to convey. Words paint pictures in our hearts and minds.
We do not depend on strict rules of grammar to receive ideas that are conveyed with
words; we can accept mangled grammar, spelling, and pronunciation, to a point. Within some
variable threshold area, an utterance need not adhere to our understanding of the "rules"
of language in order for us to comprehend it.

<p>
How can we design a computer system that can recognize ideas without depending on strict
rules of language? And then, how do we store and process those ideas?
