<h1>Rethinking the Mobile Internet</h1>

<p>

<p>
The World Wide Web has produced in a fundamental change in the way people
think, communicate, and do business.  Public and private libraries that
used to be filled with people reading books and perusing microfiche machines
are now full of people searching and browsing the Web.  Advertisers are
realizing that if they want to reach the masses, they have to set their
sights on the Web, just as they did television decades ago.  Friendships
are started and nurtured via the Web every day.
</p>

<p>
In recent years, smartphones have enabled users to carry Web access with
them every where they go.  You would think that folks would be using
their spiffy little Web-accessing phones left and right.  But they aren't.
Many mobile phone users who are otherwise Web addicts don't even <i>have</i>
mobile internet service.

</p>

<p>
What is the typical mobile Web experience like today?  Pretty much like
the desktop Web experience, only stuffed onto a display perhaps 1/15th
the size of a desktop display, controlled by more cumbersome means of
user input and interaction.  Furthermore, the internet connection is
anything but constant, forcing frequent reconnects.  For someone on the
go (i.e., a <i>mobile</i> Web user), this all adds up to a really bad
user experience.  
</p>


<h2>Mobile Web Users Are Mobile</h2>

<p>
Mobile web users are mobile.  This obvious fact seems far too elusive.
Before we take a look at the sorts of situations that mobile Web users are
likely to be in, let's start by eliminating situations in which they are
<i>not</i> likely to be in:


<ul>
<li>They will not be at their workplace, because they have access to
much more powerful desktop systems for using the Web.</li>
<li>They will not be at home, because they have access to much more
powerful desktop systems for using the Web.</li>
<li>They will not be at school, because they have access to much more
powerful desktop systems for using the Web.</li>
<li>They will not be at the library, because they have access to much
more powerful desktop systems for using the Web.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Get the picture?

<p>
Very contrary to typical desktop usage of the Web, the mobile Web user
will most likely <i>not</i> be engaged in many of the commonplace Web
activities:


<ul>
<li>They will not be looking up general reference materials.</li>
<li>They will not be posting messages on Slashdot, Reddit, or any other
"online community" sites.</li>
<li>They will not be doing academic study or research.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Granted, there will be exceptions.  Serious nerds may very well post
messages on Slashdot from a shopping mall using their mobile phone.  A
student about to give a presentation out-of-town might need to look up
a last-minute fact right before going on stage.  A bored traveller
stuck in a hotel whose wireless internet service doesn't work might
opt to use a mobile phone to catch up on the news or look for updates
on friends' blogs.  But in general, the ways that people use the Web
from their desktop machines will not be the way that people use the
Web from mobile devices.


<h2>The Mobile Web Experience</h2>

<p>
So what are the needs and desires of a mobile Web user?  The fundamentals
remain the same:  the Web provides a means of learning and communication.
The difference is that for a mobile Web user, the Web is no longer the
center of attention -- it is ancillary tool whose purpose is to assist
the user in their primary occupation.  The less time that the user has
to spend mucking about with web sites on their phone, the better, so they
can get on with what they are out and about doing.

<p>
Let's take a look at some examples.

<h3>The Traveller</h3>

<p>
Gordon is visiting California for the first time.  He knows roughly
that he will be in Orange County, specifically in and around Irvine,
Santa Ana, and Laguna Niguel.  Before he leaves, he sits down at his
desktop computer and logs into a web service that lets him enter his
planned destinations.  Either through original programming or through
user-added content (preferably both), this web service can display
a selection of places that Gordon might want to visit.  (For example,
restaurants, theme parks, tourist traps, neat stuff to photograph, etc.)

<p>
Gordon can select some (or all) of these suggestions, storing his
preferences in the system.  If there's anything he thinks he might want
to do that <i>isn't</i> listed (e.g., a good Chinese restaurant or
a place to make photocopies), he can enter that information into the
web service.  The service can then petition other users to provide this
information on Gordon's behalf.

<p>
When Gordon arrives in California, he first checks into his hotel, puts
away his luggage, and whips out his mobile phone as he's walking back
to the lobby.  "It's dinner time," thinks Gordon, "I wonder if there
are any recommendations for Chinese food yet."  He brings up the mobile
version of the web service, which promptly tells him that no one has
responded to his request for information about good Chinese restaurants
yet, but via a simple Google search twelve nearby FedEx-Kinko's shops
have been added to his potential internary.


<p>
Not wanting to risk trying a bad Chinese restaurant, Gordon pulls up
the rest of his potential iternary.  Since the mobile phone system knows
roughly where Gordon is at, he can sort the itenary by distance, showing
him that there's a recommended Mexican restaurant nearby.

<p>
The next day, Gordon is taking photographs down by Laguna Beach (as
suggested by the web service as being a popular spot for photographers
and painters).  When lunchtime rolls around, he whips out his mobile
phone again.  This time, someone has provided a recommendation for Chinese
food: Pickup Stix in nearby Laguna Niguel.  Gordon hurries over and is
superbly delighted with his meal.  

<p>
Later that week, Gordon is giving a presentation on functional programming
languages at a local university, and needs to photocopy some materials
beforehand.  Yet again, he whips out his mobile phone and requests the listing
of FedEx-Kinko's shops, sorted by distance.  He picks the nearest one and
gets his photocopying finished with plenty of time to spare.

<p>
At the end of the week, Gordon returns home, having visited a good two-thirds
of the places on his potential itenary.  After unpacking, he sits down at
his desktop computer, and decides to give back to the online community by
offering his
rating of the various places that were recommended to him, and providing
any new recommendations that he discovered on his own.


<h3>Geographic Reminders</h3>

<p>
[This one really only uses the Web on the desktop; a regular mobile phone
with no internet access could serve just fine as the mobile client.]

<p>
Julie lives in St. Charles, Missouri.  She spends most of her time working
as the co-founder of an applied mathematics think-tank firm, but enjoys
everything from volunteer activities to photography to shopping in the
various communities around the greater St. Louis area.  She is constantly
finding herself forgetting something that she intended to do on one side
of town until she has driven clear over to the other.

<p>
Fed up with this, she was happy to discover a web service that lets her
store reminders of planned activities and associate them with different
parts of the city.  For example, she might enter:


<ul>
<li>Purchase decorative lamp at home furnishing shop (Clayton)</li>
<li>Drop off proposed artwork for church project (Chesterfield)</li>
<li>Return library books (Hazelwood)</li>
<li>Take new pictures of the Arch for personal web site (St. Louis)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Since, as with Gordon, the mobile phone system knows roughly where Julie
is at any given time, it can remind her via SMS message or a VoiceXML-based
telephone call whenever she is nearby one of the places where she has
something to do.  Of course, the system cannot guarantee that she has her
library books or her camera with her, but at least it helps her to
remember in case she does.


<h2>Objection: Lack of Privacy</h2>

<p>

Do we really want to share our geographical position with some web
service?  Isn't that a violation of our privacy?

<p>
As mobile phone users, we're already sharing our geographical position
with the phone company.  What they do with this information beyond route
calls to us is unknown, but they could in theory have charts showing
everywhere we have been.  (Or at least, everywhere our phone has been.)

<p>
[I'm not sure exactly how accurate the phone companies can be with
this, but I suspect they can at least ascertain which zip code we're
in, if not more.]


<h2>How to Make Money</h2>

<p>
Of course, if people are going to work to provide the infrastructure
for such systems, we can't expect it all to be done for free.  How could
these mobile Web systems possibly be profitable?  The normal route --
advertising -- seems awkward, since the goal is to make information
retrieval as quick and painless as possible.

<p>
One option is to simply charge the users outright.  Maybe tack $5
or $10 a month onto their mobile phone bill for access to these services.
This might work for a while, but eventually someone will find a way to
undercut it, just as online learning community services that used to
cost hundreds of thousands of dollars can now be set up for much, much
cheaper (possibly free).

<p>
Another option is for the phone companies themselves to subsidize
the cost of development and maintenance for these systems.  Going on the
idea that users will actually <i>like</i> the services, the phone companies
should see more people paying for more mobile internet access, resulting
in more profit for them.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
Using the Web from a mobile phone should be a quick and painless
experience, resulting in the user obtaining as little information as
is required for them to turn off their phone and get on with what
they are doing.  To maximize this, users may find benefit in providing
web services with information about their future plans up front, so that
these services can be better prepared to display only the most pertinent
data.  These services may work best when they are privy to knowing the
user's geographical position.

<p>
The core technology for such mobile web services already exists.  There
may need to be a bit of work done here and there to bring everything
together, but the existing Web and mobile telephone systems have laid
good foundations.  So far, the mobile Web experience hasn't caught on
as much as one might expect because too little has been done to stop
and think about what a mobile Web user actually wants to accomplish.
