<p>My grandfather managed the reconstruction of the Robert E. Lee Bridge in Richmond, Virginia
during the 1980's. He worked on many other bridges as well, but this one holds a special
place in my memory as I had opportunity to visit the construction site,
and my grandparents shared more details with me regarding this bridge project than any other.

<p>In 2008, Jennifer and I searched the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/">Library of Congress</a>
newspaper archive for articles about the project.</p>

<h3>Replacement Is Studied For Richmond Bridges</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The Washington Post, January 18, 1980.</em></p>
<p>A Richmond landmark apparently is headed for destruction.</p>
<p>The State Highways and Transportation Commission today approved a design study to replace
the crumbling Robert E. Lee Bridge over the James River, which is nearly 50 years old.</p>
<p>Once the new $42 million bridge is built, the existing bridge will be torn down, officials
said.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Bridging the James</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The Richmond Times, March 21, 1986</em>.</p>
<p>
Men, metal and concrete are creating pilings and platforms for the new $32.2 million
Robert E. Lee Bridge. The structure is rising beside the potholed span across the
James River that cost $1 million to build 52 years ago. Nearly 100 people are surveying,
bending, hammering and building the 28 pilings for the six-lane, three-quarter-mile-long
bridge, the most expensive highway project inside a Virginia city. The project has been
disrupted several times by high water, but it is still scheduled for completion in
October 1987. The 111-foot-wide bridge also will have room for a sidewalk and a lane
for bicycles.</p>
<p>Nearly $20 million more will be spent on the streets leading onto the bridge.</p>

<h3>Span Workers Critically Hurt</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The Richmond Times, October 3, 1987</em>.</p>
<p>Two men working on the new Robert E. Lee Bridge fell yesterday, one as far as 80 feet,
after a steel cable snapped and spilled them from a platform on which they had been
standing.</p>
<p>The men were identified as Leo Sheppard, 29, of the 9100 block of Fargo Road in
Henrico County and Will Saunders of New Kent County. Both were in critical and unstable
condition at the Medical College of Virginia Hospitals, an MCV spokesman said.</p>

<p>Sheppard and Saunders each suffered &#8220;massive orthopedic injuries &#8212;
fractured legs, fractured pelvis, fractured arms, fractured feet,&#8221; said Dr.
Alfred S. Gervin, director of emergency medical services and trauma service at MCV.</p>
<p>However, doctors have &#8220;identified no major internal injuries in the head and
chest at this time,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The mortality rate for that fall is 90-plus percent,&#8221; Dr. Gervin said.
&#8220;It&#8217;s surprising they look as good as they do. Most people who fall that
distance rupture their aorta, destroy their kidneys, break their neck &#8212; they die.
These guys didn&#8217;t do that. I think both have a 70 percent chance of survival.&#8221;</p>

<p>The incident occurred about 12:30 p.m. as the men were preparing to move a form traveler,
a support structure used when pouring concrete. It was in the north-center of the bridge.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the traveler apparatus is a large platform, about 16 feet by 50 feet,
which was directly beneath the bridge. The men had just gotten on the platform when one of
several cables hoisting it snapped, said John Wray Jr., chief engineer for the state
Department of Transportation.</p>
<p>That caused the platform to tilt and dangle precariously from the remaining cables.
Sheppard fell an estimated 70 to 80 feet into shallow water at the edge of a man-made
causeway, Patrolman James A. Zamparello said.</p>
<p>Saunders managed to grasp the broken cable, attached to a crane, but could not hold
on and fell an estimated 30 to 40 feet onto the rock causeway, officials said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The choker broke, and he grabbed on to it,&#8221; said Tom McCarthy, executive
vice president of the bridge division of McCarthy Bros Co., a St. Louis company which is
the bridge&#8217;s prime contractor. &#8220;The crane operator attempted to lower him down,
and he lost his grip while he was on the way down. He just couldn&#8217;t hold on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wray said that &#8220;from what we know, we see no gross negligence by anybody.&#8221;
The contractor, he added, has &#8220;had no problems up to this point. And they wouldn&#8217;t
have had any now if the cable had not broken. That&#8217;s the bottom line &#8212; a faulty
cable broke.&#8221;</p>

<p>A safety official from the company was en route last night to inspect the equipment,
McCarthy said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was an inch and a quarter diameter cable which should not have snapped,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;We don&#8217;t know why &#8212; not at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>The $32.2 million, six-lane bridge is scheduled to open next year.</p>
<p>Completion has been delayed by bad weather, and floods have washed out the
contractor&#8217;s causeways five times.</p></blockquote>

<h3>River Construction</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The Richmond Times, November 1, 1987</em>.</p>
<p>The James River may no longer be the city&#8217;s center of commerce, but
it&#8217;s certainly the center of construction. The contractor building the new, six-lane
Robert E. Lee Bridge has been reminded of the river&#8217;s power: The project&#8217;s
causeways have been washed out five times. Overlooking the James is the Pavilion, an
addition to Ethyl Corp. that will include meeting and eating space.</p></blockquote>
