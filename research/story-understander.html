<h3>Proposal</h3>

<p>
The goal of this project is to build a computer system capable of "reading" simple
stories and demonstrating an "understanding" of the stories by correctly answering
questions. This is a task often assigned to elementary school students as part of
training them in reading comprehension.

<p>
More broadly, this project forms an initial testing and exploration framework toward
developing computer systems capable of understanding more complex passages of text,
with increasingly practical applications. By isolating this particular project to a
small subset of the overall problem, it should be easier to reach both dead ends not
worth pursuing and successful approaches to continue exploring.

<h3>Hasn't something like this been done before?</h3>

No claim is made to an original problem idea here. Many individuals and groups have
made attempts and progress at creating computer systems that can approximate an
understanding of natural language. While much excellent work has been done, I still
view this as an open problem, and hope to come up with something interesting.
