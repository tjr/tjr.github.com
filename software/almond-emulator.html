<h1>Almond Emulator</h1>

The <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/almondemulator/id304062062?mt=8">Almond
Emulator</a> is a trivial application that I wrote to learn about
Apple iPhone development. In my opinion, the application is mildly
amusing for a few seconds, but it has little lasting value.

<p>
Ashamed of myself, I eventually pulled it from the iPhone app store,
but received requests from actual people saying that they wanted me to
put it back. So I
<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/almondemulator/id304062062?mt=8">put it back</a>.

<h2>User Reviews</h2>

<p>
Even more awesome than the Almond Emulator application itself are the
reviews that users have written about it. Here are a few of them:

<blockquote>
With technology so prevalent in our lives, we often forget to take
time out of our days to think about the little things in life. Thats
why this app is so great. When I'm sitting on the cold, sterile train
on the way to my dead end job where I count the days until I feel
death's frigid embrace I can pretend that I am in a better time,
enjoying an almond in the warm summer sun on my grandfather's farm.

I can't say enough about Almond Emulator and how it's helped enhance
my sensory experience of the almond nut. The interface is simple to
use, accessible for all ages to enjoy. It's really like holding a
perfect almond in my hand (I almost tried to eat the phone!). I was
blown away by how realistic the almond sound was. The presentation is
outstanding, the graphics are crisp, and you can't beat the content. I
can only hope this is the first app in a long line of food simulations
that can really educate the public. The update even gives you the
chocolate covered version yum! My only gripe is that this should be
under the Productivity category in the app store because of its
usefulness.

Not Saliva Proof: I had to trash two iPhones due to failed attempts at
tasting these almonds. And I'd do it again. Amazing. Thank you.

This app brought me to tears numerous times. The impeccable and
awe-striking beauty and passion that the author successfully portrayed
in this wonderful work of art is unmatched and will be something that
is passed on for generations to come.
