<p>
The first formal release of <i>The GNU C Reference Manual</i> (on
<a href="http://ftp.gnu.org/">ftp.gnu.org</a>) came in 2008.  After
years of part-time effort bringing the manual to that point (writing a
book-length document on a subject like C can take intense motivation),
I finally decided that it was good enough to let other people start
reading it. Several subsequent releases were made of the manual,
adding more material and fixing old mistakes.

<p>
In 2012, I was informed that a new C programming book was going to
supersede my own in the GNU Project. Rather than see this work
disappear, I am making the last published edition available here:

<ul>
<li><a href="gnu-c-manual-0.2.2.tar.gz">Texinfo source code</a></li>
<li><a href="gnu-c-manual-html/">HTML for online reading</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Artwork</h2>

In preparation for the first release, I asked
<a href="http://www.tug.org/interviews/bibby.html">Duane Bibby</a>
to draw some whimsical C-related gnu characters to display on
the manual's website:

<a href="/images/gnu-db-2.jpg"><img src="/images/gnu-db-2-small.jpg"></a>
</center>

<h2>All Good Things...</h2>

<p>
As a (very) part-time volunteer effort, I only made this manual the
focus of my attention for occasional hacking spurts. Perhaps had I put
more regular effort into it, GNU Project leadership would not have had
desire to replace it with a newer text... but in any event, I had an
awesome time with this manual. I got to directly work with and learn
from GNU Project founder Dr. Richard Stallman, as well as many other
great people around the world. My sincere thanks to all of you.
