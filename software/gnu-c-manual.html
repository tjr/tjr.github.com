<h1>On the Topic of The GNU C Reference Manual</h1>

<p>
<a href="/">Home</a> : <a href="/software/">Software</a> : by Trevis Rothwell, February 2012

<p>
The first formal release of <i>The GNU C Reference Manual</i> (on
<a href="http://ftp.gnu.org/">ftp.gnu.org</a>) came in 2007.  After
years of part-time effort bringing the manual to that point (writing a
book-length document on a subject like C can take intense motivation),
I finally decided that it was good enough to let other people start
reading it. Several subsequent releases were made of the manual,
adding more material and fixing old mistakes.

<p>
In 2012, I was informed that a new C programming book was going to
supersede my own in the GNU Project. Rather than see this work
disappear, I am making the last published edition (v0.2.2) available here:

<ul>
<li><a href="/downloads/gnu-c-manual-0.2.2.tar.gz">Texinfo source code</a></li>
<li><a href="/gnu-c-manual-0.2.2/">HTML for online reading</a></li>
<li><a href="/downloads/gnu-c-manual-0.2.2.pdf">PDF for nice typography</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
As of this writing,
the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-c-manual/">web page for
this manual</a> was still active at gnu.org as well.

<h2>Artwork</h2>

<p>
In preparation for the first release, I asked
<a href="http://www.tug.org/interviews/bibby.html">Duane Bibby</a>
to draw some whimsical C-related gnu characters to display on
the manual's website:

<center>
<a href="/images/gnu-db-1.jpg"><img src="/images/gnu-db-1-small.jpg"></a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="/images/gnu-db-2.jpg"><img src="/images/gnu-db-2-small.jpg"></a>
</center>

<p>
Duane transferred copyright ownership of the drawings to me, and I
in turn transferred copyright ownership to the Free Software
Foundation.

<h2>All Good Things...</h2>

<p>
As a (very) part-time volunteer, I only made this manual the focus of
my attention for occasional hacking spurts. Perhaps had I put more
regular effort into it, there would have been no demand for a newer
text...  but in any event, I had an awesome time with this manual. I
got to directly work with and learn from GNU Project founder
Dr. Richard Stallman, as well as many other great people around the
world. My sincere thanks to all of you.
