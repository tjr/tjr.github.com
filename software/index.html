Practical software experience includes building applications for the Apple iOS mobile platform, web
application development, formal and ad hoc software testing, and technical writing. If you need something
along these lines done for your business, feel free to <a href="mailto:tjr@acm.org">send me an email</a>
with a project inquiry. Due to keeping a fairly busy schedule, smaller projects may be easier to arrange
than larger; high-paying, multi-month projects are awesome, but so is authoring a manual or doing a few
hours of testing!

<h3>Software Projects</h3>

<p>
These are some of my own software projects that I have released:

<ul>
<li><a href="cedar-rapids-online">Cedar Rapids Online</a>, an online learning community web service.</li>
<li><a href="lets-decide">Let's Decide</a>, an application of the borda count preference schedule algorithm for
the Apple iPhone.</li>
<li><a href="music-measurement">Music Measurement</a>, a simple music time calculator for the Apple iPhone.</li>
<li>And for some reason I saw fit to make the <a href="almond-emulator">Almond Emulator</a> iPhone program, a
trivial getting-started application that has become surprisingly popular.
</ul>

<p>
I also have worked on software for several avionics and avionics simulaiton systems, and on the iPhone client
for <a href="http://www.gocanvas.com/">Canvas Business Applications</a>.

<h3>Documentation</h3>
