<p>
A lot of my software development work has been behind the scenes. I've
worked on
several <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_management_system">flight
management avionics systems</a>, built the prototype for
the <a href="http://www.gocanvas.com/">Canvas Business
Applications</a> iPhone client, and presently am involved with
avionics simulation software.  And I can't really share openly a lot
of details about these projects.

<p>
Here though are some other things I have worked on that I am free to talk about...

<h2>Software</h2>

<p>
These are some of my own software projects that I have released:

<ul>
<li><a href="cedar-rapids-online">Cedar Rapids Online</a>, an online
learning community web service.</li>
<li><a href="lets-decide">Let's Decide</a>, an application of the
borda count preference schedule algorithm for the Apple iPhone.</li>
<li><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/music-measurement/id305144557?mt=8">Music
Measurement</a>, a simple music time calculator for the Apple
iPhone.</li>
<li>And for some reason I saw fit to make
the <a href="almond-emulator">Almond Emulator</a> iPhone program, a
trivial getting-started application that has become surprisingly
popular.
</ul>

<p>
You can also take a look at my listing
of <a href="http://github.com/tjr/">projects on GitHub</a>, which may
include things not listed here.

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-c-manual/">The GNU C
Reference Manual</a> (at www.gnu.org)... known to have been a resource
referenced for courses at:
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>Bucknell University</li>
  <li>Dickinson College</li>
  <li>Florida International University</li>
  <li>Louisiana State University</li>
  <li>San Jose State University</li>
  <li>University of Arizona</li>
  <li>University of California at San Diego</li>
  <li>University of Washington</li>
  </ul>
<p>
Wow!
</li>
</ul>
