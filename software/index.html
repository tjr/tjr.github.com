<p>
A lot of my software development work has been behind the scenes. I've worked on several flight
management avionics systems, built the prototype for the <a href="http://www.gocanvas.com/">Canvas
Business Applications</a> iPhone client, and presently am involved with avionics simulation software.
And I can't really share openly a lot of details about these projects.

<p>
Here though are some other things I have worked on that I am free to talk about...

<h3>Software Projects</h3>

<p>
These are some of my own software projects that I have released:

<ul>
<li><a href="cedar-rapids-online">Cedar Rapids Online</a>, an online learning community web service.</li>
<li><a href="lets-decide">Let's Decide</a>, an application of the borda count preference schedule algorithm for
the Apple iPhone.</li>
<li><a href="music-measurement">Music Measurement</a>, a simple music time calculator for the Apple iPhone.</li>
<li>And for some reason I saw fit to make the <a href="almond-emulator">Almond Emulator</a> iPhone program, a
trivial getting-started application that has become surprisingly popular.
</ul>

<p>
You can also take a look at my listing of <a href="http://github.com/tjr/">projects on GitHub</a>, which
may include things not listed here.

<h3>Documentation</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-c-manual/">The GNU C Reference Manual</a> (at www.gnu.org)... known to have been a resource referenced for courses at:
