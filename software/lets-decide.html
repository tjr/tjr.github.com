<p>
Let's Decide is a program for the <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">Apple iPhone</a>.

<p>
You can use this application to arrive at a decision between
multiple options, such as selecting a movie to watch or what to have for dinner.
All you have to do is:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Enter the options to decide between</li>
<li>Enter the names of the people voting</li>
<li>For each person, arrange the options in their preferred order</li>
</ol>
<p>
The application can then display the result of combining everyone's preferences,
using a borda count algorithm.

<h3>Borda Count</h3>

<p>
There are multiple ways of tallying up votes in an election. "Majority rules" is perhaps the most simple,
and in many cases may be adequate. Looking only at which option has the most first-place votes, though,
totally ignores other aspects of voter preferences. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borda_count">borda
count voting method looks not only at</a> first-place votes, but the ranking of <i>every</i> option being considered.
As such, it is useful in many everyday decision-making tasks.

<p>
For example, imagine that you and ten coworkers are going out for lunch, and have to decide between three
restaurants. If five of you most prefer restaurant A, three of you most prefer restaurant B, and three of you
most prefer restaurant C, then a majority-rules election would pick restaurant A. But what if the six people who
most preferred restaurants B and C ranked restaurant A last? Then while a clear majority of five people most prefer
restaurant A, a clear majority of six people <i>least</i> prefer restaurant A. Perhaps selecting restaurant B or
C would be more agreeable to everyone.
