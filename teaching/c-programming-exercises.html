<h2>Primitive Data Types</h2>

<p>
C supports several primitive data types for storing basic information
in the form of characters and numbers. You can find a listing of these
data types at: [insert link]

<p>
Please write a C program that stores the following values into variables
of an appropriate type, and then print out the values of the variables
using printf:

<ul>
<li>42</li>
<li>29,302</li>
<li>793,820,192,302</li>
<li>3.14159</li>
<li>m</li>
</ul>

<p>
Hint: read about C data types at [insert link]. Read about printf at
[insert link]. Consider that it is sometimes useful to use the
smallest possible data type that will store the values you need to
store.
