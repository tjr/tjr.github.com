<p>
Programming in C isn't very tasteful. It never really was, but
especially compared to newer languages like Java, Python, and Ruby, it
can be quite a pain. But nevertheless it lingers on in embedded
programming such as avionics, and partially hidden in the form of
Objective-C in Mac and iOS applications.

<p>
In my observation, many computer science college graduates are not
prepared to face the mess that is C programming, but they are tossed
into it anyway, with too little concrete help. The goal of this course
is to provide students with enough C programming knowledge to be more
productive, code with reasonably good style, and avoid common
pitfalls.

<p>
Specifically, students should leave the class:

<ul>
<li>knowing how to use primitive and custom data types</li>
<li>understanding how operator precedence works, and how to avoid
having to remember how it works</li>
<li>understanding pointers and how they relate to the underlying
memory</li>
<li>knowing how to write functions, and how to structure a large
program into reasonably-sized functions</li>
<li>understanding variable scope</li>
<li>understanding static and dynamic memory management, and when it is
appropriate to use which</li>
<li>being familiar with basic usage of the standard C library, and how
to use other third-party libraries</li>
<li>being familiar with the GNU C Compiler, including common compiler
options and the difference between standard C and extensions provided
by the compiler</li>
<li>knowing how to build applications that mix C with other
programming languages, in order to take make the best use of each</li>
<li>knowing how to use the GNU Debugger to do basic debugging of a C
program</li>
</ul>

<p>
Who should go through the course? Students should ideally have some
programming experience already; it would be too time consuming to try
to explain basic concepts of programming and computer usage along with
the intricacies of C. Since C is so daunting, students could already
be using C in a professional setting and still potentially benefit
from the course. Likewise, bright, motivated students with little or
no programming experience are welcome to come as well, but be aware
that the pace of the course will be fast.

<p>
The format of the class will consist of: short lectures on a topic,
in-class programming problem sets (completed by the students with
help from teaching assistants), and then review of student solutions
with presentation of correct solutions, if needed.

<p>
Students should bring their own laptop, on which they will install
and run a virtual machine operating system (preferably before the
first class session) so that we are all working from the same baseline
of operating system and installed software.

<h2>Exercises</h2>

<p>
These exercises are to be completed by the student during the class,
with help from the teachers, as needed:

The format of this class is blatantly and proudly based on the MIT IAP
relational database programming course, which the present author took
in 2012.
