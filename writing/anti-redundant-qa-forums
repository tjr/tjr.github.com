    <h2>Anti-Redundant Q&A Forums</h2>

<hr>
    <p>
One of the major features of most successful online communities is the question-and-answer
forum, in which users can learn from other users. It is not uncommon for the same questions
to be asked over and over again by new users of the site.  Unless carefully moderated, this
can result in much redundant information being stored in the online community system, but
more detrimentally, this can become weary for the users who are constantly providing nearly
identical answers to scores of people.  As the expert users get fed up with the redundant
novice questions, their interest in the community can wane, resulting in novice users
helping novice users, rather than expert users helping novice users.
</p>

<h2>Example Problems</h2>

<p>
For some examples, let's consider the
<a href="http://photo.net/bboard/forum?topic_id=1545">Canon EOS forum</a> at
<a href="http://photo.net/">photo.net</a>.  A great wealth of useful information is
stored in the 20,000+ posts on this forum, yet it is also a prime example of redundant
questions.

<p>
The premise is this: the forum caters to Canon EOS users of all levels of experience.
The more knowledgeable in the group tend to ask very specific questions that have either
not been discussed before, or have not been discussed enough for the user to be able to
find them after a reasonable search of the old posts.  Some novice users, on the other
hand, tend to ask questions without looking at even the questions that were posted the
previous day.

<ul>
<li>Monday: Novice User #1 asks for opinions about buying a 400D camera vs. a 40D camera.  A dozen
experienced users offer useful replies, and the novice users is happy.</li>
<br>
<li>Tuesday: Novice User #2 asks for opinions about buying a 400D camera vs. a 40D camera.  Eight
experienced users offer useful replies (noticeably similar to the replies offered the day before),
while two experienced users post mildly angry remarks about having just covered this topic 
yesterday.</li>
<br>
<li>Wednesday: Novice User #3 asks for opinions about buying a 400D camera vs. a 40D camera.  Five
experienced users offer moderately useful answers (they are getting tired of answering the
question), while five other experienced users go off into a lengthy 10-post sub-thread complaining
about people who don't bother to read earlier messages to find their answers.</li>
<br>
<li>Thursday: Novice User #4 asks for opinions about buying a 400D camera vs. a 40D camera.  One
experienced user posts a link to Monday's discussion, and two experienced users make jokes along
the lines of "here we go again..."</li>
<br>
<li>Friday: Novice User #5 asks for opinions about selling his 400D camera to buy a 40D camera
instead.  All experienced users are too bored with this general theme to even read the question,
and it goes completely unanswered.</li>
</ul>

<p>
A slight exaggeration?  Perhaps, but I think that anyone who's been reading a reasonably popular
question and answer forum for a year or so will recognize a substantial nugget of truth here.


<h3>So what are the problems in this situation?</h3>

<ol>
<li>After several rounds of this, novice users start getting angry replies, or possibly worse,
no replies at all.</li>
<br>
<li>After several rounds of this, and especially after several months' worth of rounds of this,
experienced users get bored with the discussion forum, because a substantial amount of discussion
revolves around rehashed issues and users getting upset about rehashed issues.  Some experienced
users may even stop using the forum, taking their experience with them.</li>
<br>
<li>Redundant discussions that aren't moderated into oblivion will lurk in the forum archive
indefintely.  When some future user <i>does</i> search the archives for their answer, will they
find a constructive thread of ideas, or a digressing thread of complains about no-one bothering
to search the archives?  If they find the latter first, and especially if they find numerous
examples of the latter, they might become disappointed with the quality of content found in the
forum and move on.</li>
</ol>
