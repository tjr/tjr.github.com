    <h2>No Problem, It's Just Art</h2>

Last week I filled out an application to be able to sell stock photographs
through <a href="http://www.istockphoto.com/">iStockPhoto</a>. This morning
I received an email back from them, declining my application and citing
reasons such as inadequate photo composition skill and lack of creativity. Ouch!

<p>
They did inform me that I could reapply with different sample photographs, but
I don't plan to do so. This all reminds me of why I have not pursued photography
as a business in the first place, and that it's okay not to.

<p>
As you develop skill in an area, it's natural to wonder if you could possibly
turn it into a business and make money doing something you enjoy. Ideally, all of
us are making money doing <i>something</i> we enjoy, but we don't necessarily have
to make money doing <i>everything</i> that we enjoy.

<p>
Several years ago, a friend who enjoyed my photographs asked me to take pictures
at her upcoming wedding. I agreed. She was happy with the results, and I was happy
to collect a few hundred dollars. But I felt stressed. Not because of my friend,
but because of the pressure that I put on myself to create photographs that she
and her family would be pleased with. When I go out and take pictures for my
own enjoyment, the only thing that matters is if I'm happy with the results or
not. When I do it for somebody else, I have to make sure that they're happy.

I work to make other people happy often. I am a professional software engineer,
and while I sometimes hack on programs for fun, I mostly endeavor to build
software systems that meet the needs of others. They usually don't care about
whether if I had a delightful experience building their software in Lisp or if
I had a distasteful experience building their software in C just so long as it
works and does what they need. And there's nothing wrong with this; it's the
way business ought to be! Serving the needs of the customers.

<p>
But I find comfort and solace in photography. It's something I can do to
relax and record how I see the world around me. I'm sure that I could be a
professional wedding photographer if I wanted to do that. I'm sure that I could
align my vision for photography with what iStockPhoto needs and supply them with
pictures to sell. But photography isn't my business. For me, it's just art.

the sculptures. But so what? Evidently somebody else did, and that's awesome.</i>
