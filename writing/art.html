    <h2>No Problem, It's Just Art</h2>

<p>
As you develop skill in an area, it's natural to wonder if you could possibly
turn it into a business and make money doing something you enjoy. Ideally, all of
us are making money doing <i>something</i> we enjoy, but we don't necessarily have
to make money doing <i>everything</i> that we enjoy. It may be good for us to
reserve some things that we just do for our own enjoyment, rather than
turn our every interest into a business venture.

<p>
Some activities lend themselves more to business prospects than others. I
personally greatly enjoy computer science, music, photography, and writing. There
are people who are successful in each of these areas; it's totally plausible that
I could be too.  But should I?  Maybe not.

<p>
To engage in an activity as a business often requires setting aside your
own personal preferences in favor of doing what is in the best interest of
customers or clients. I find that the more artistic the activity is, the more
difficult this can be to do.

<h3>Music</h3>

<p>
I can appreciate and enjoy listening to a wide variety of music. But when it
comes to creating music, I have a fairly narrow set of musical preferences... and
they don't overlap very well with the sorts of music that makes a lot of money.
I actually am part-owner in a <a href="http://www.atmospherecontrolmusic.com/">music
production company</a>, though so far we've put a lot more money into it than
we've gotten out of it. I think it'd be pretty awesome to break even, and simply
be able to let the music projects pay for themselves. Maybe someday we'll get
there, but I'm not convinced that music production makes a lot of sense as a
business venture.

<p>
Can it make sense? It depends on what you do with it. I know someone who gets
most of his regular income from royalty payments for music he produced for some
television programs. Sounds pretty good, though competition is fierce. There aren't
a whole lot of television programs compared to the number of people interested in
a career in music.

<p>
If you're bound and determined to make money as a musician, it can certainly
happen, but it will likely be very challenging and you may or may not enjoy
the kinds of music you have to create in order to get paid. You're not creating
to your own tastes, but to the tastes of people who want to pay for music.

<h3>Photography</h3>

<p>
Last week I filled out an application to be able to sell stock photographs
through <a href="http://www.istockphoto.com/">iStockPhoto</a>. This morning
I received an email back from them, declining my application and citing
reasons such as inadequate photo composition skill and lack of creativity. Ouch!

<p>
They did inform me that I could reapply with different sample photographs, but
I don't plan to do so. This all reminds me of why I have not pursued photography
as a business in the first place, and that it's okay not to.

<p>
Several years ago, a friend who enjoyed my photographs asked me to take pictures
at a family event. I agreed. She was happy with the results, and I was happy
to collect a few hundred dollars. But I felt stressed. Not because of my friend, as
she did absolutely nothing to pressure me, but because of the pressure that I put
on myself to create photographs that she and her family would be pleased with.
When I go out and take pictures for my own enjoyment, the only thing that matters
is if I'm happy with the results or not. When I do it for somebody else, I have
to make sure that they're happy.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/trothwell/5186808287/" title="IMG_5421 by trothwell, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1004/5186808287_23db9d87b0_m.jpg" width="160" height="240" alt="IMG_5421" class="photoleft" align="left"></a>

<p>
I'm sure that if I tried, I could be a professional portrait photographer. I'm sure
that I could align my vision for photography with what iStockPhoto needs and supply
them with pictures to sell. But I find comfort and solace in photography. It's
something I can do to relax and record how I see the world around me. It's not my
business.

<h3>Computer Science</h3>

<p>
I have personal preferences in software development. I enjoy using Emacs to
edit code, and I prefer writing code in Lisp and Python, and I am fond of the
principles of free software as set forth by the GNU Project. But I find it
pretty easy to set these preferences aside in order to build software systems
for paying customers and clients.

<p>
Software engineering is where I find myself most at home as far as business
ventures go. Unlike with music, there are lots of opportunities to create value
for people in exchange for money. Unlike with photography, I don't feel any
particular interest in maintaining artistic purity or building software only
for my own enjoyment. Things illegal or (by my own standards) immoral aside, I would
be open to building whatever a customer may want. Some opportunities I may turn
down if I have a choice to favor my preferences, but I'll take on opportunities
that I may not be thrilled with when no choice is available.

<h3>But Hey, That's Just Me</h3>

<p>
Maybe you enjoy creating photographs that please other people, and want to make
a business out of that.
