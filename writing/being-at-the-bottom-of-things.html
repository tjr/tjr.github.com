    <h2>Being at the Bottom of Things</h2>

<p>
Computer scientist <a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/">Donald Knuth</a> stopped using
email in 1990 in order to devote his efforts to researching and writing books, and explained that email
"is a wonderful thing for people whose role in life is to be on top of things. But not for me; my role
is to be on the bottom of things. What I do takes long hours of studying and uninterruptible concentration."

<p>
I don't think that what I do needs to be as uninterruptible as what Professor Knuth does, but I've
increasingly been feeling inundated with digital tidbits of information, and decreasingly feeling
productive with my time.

<h3>Aggregates of Informational Tidbits</h3>

<p>
It all starts out harmless enough. Maybe there's some <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">online
community website</a> that has lots of interesting content, updated frequently. On the surface, this
is a good thing. I've read many web pages and blog posts and user comments that have been insightful,
helpful, and educational. But I've also spent countless hours clicking links like a hen pecking at
seeds, consuming content on the web that is superficially related to my interests, but somehow lacking
real substance.

<p>
Today's technology makes it trivial to find more and more sources of digital tidbits to consume:
<a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/">Twitter</a>,
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a>, <a href="http://news.google.com/">news aggregates</a>...
the list goes on, and new websites are being created all the time that offer yet more things
to look at and hyperlinks to poke. I used to think that <a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a>
was being overly authoritarian by moderating which article submissions were published. Now, in
retrospect, the rate at which new information flowed from Slashdot was much more manageable, and
since they only published the articles that they thought were truly interesting, odds are good
that readers got a good helping of interesting content and minimal fluff.

<p>
I seriously doubt that these flows of digital tidbits are going to diminish any time soon. Perhaps
particular websites will fade into obscurity&mdash;I wouldn't be surprised to see Facebook supplanted
in a few years just as MySpace was before them. But I suspect that the nonstop availability of
constantly updated information is here to stay.

<h3>Digital Candy</h3>

<p>
Sometimes I feel like just shutting it all off, Knuth-style. Deleting my accounts on such websites,
vowing to not return. That feels like a promising idea initially, but then I consider all of the
truly valuable things I have learned from these constant flows of information. Sure, most of it
wasn't very valuable, but those few things! I don't want to miss out on what's good by throwing out
what's trivial.

<p>
At least, I purport that this is the reason for not shutting it all off. Maybe the real reason is
that I've developed some sort of mental addiction to this digital candy. Even if there's no real
nourishment, some part of my mind finds enjoyment out of being constantly updated with information
that is easy to discard. And in so doing, it seems harder than it used to be to concentrate on
things that I believe to be of value. My mind feels like hopping from one topic to another.

<h3>Is Google Making Us Stupid?</h3>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/trothwell/5112956558/" title="IMG_3380.JPG by trothwell, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1311/5112956558_8c6857d626_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="IMG_3380.JPG" class="photo" align="right"/></a>

<p>
I shared my thoughts along these lines with a colleague, who pointed me toward an article that
asks <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/print/2008/07/is-google-making-us-stupid/6868/">Is
Google Making Us Stupid?</a> The article does not blame Google directly, but looks at how
the world wide web and hypertext have drastically changed the way that we read. The author notes
that people in times past were concerned that other advances in how we handle information
would be detrimental: the printing press, and even the advancement of writing things down at all
(instead of keeping everything known in one's memory).

<p>
It is difficult for me to perceive the threat of the printing press, having grown up surrounded
by books. It is even more difficult for me to perceive the written word itself as a threat.
(I have, however, noticed that once I write something down, it seems as if my mind then feels
free to move that information out of active memory, suggesting to me (anecdotally, of course)
that our minds put forth extra effort to retain knowledge that they know is not recorded
elsewhere.)
But it is not difficult at all for me to perceive the threat that is the current state of
the popular world wide web.

<p>
There are plenty of long written materials on the web: articles, essays, even whole books. But
the primary culprit, if there is indeed anything wrong with the web, may be the recent trend
toward authoring ever-shorter pieces of information. The blog format makes
it easy to publish three-paragraph ideas, or even one-paragraph ideas. Services like Twitter
make it easy to publish one-sentence ideas. Neither of these are necessarily bad in and of
themselves, but as we increasingly substitute one-sentence ideas for book-length ideas, I am
concerned that not only will be severely limit the depths of what we learn, but we may even
form bad mental habits that make it difficult to use our minds for anything beyond
one-sentence ideas.

<h3>IANAP</h3>

<p>
I am not a psychologist, and course my musings here should be taken with a grain or
two of salt. But in my own life I feel that exchanging a moderate flow of articles and
books for a constant flow of sentences leads down a path that I don't really want to follow.
I've not yet deleted any of my accounts on any information aggregate websites, but I am
trying to monitor myself and cut back. If my own willpower doesn't prove to be enough,
then deleting and blocking things until my mental habits reform is certainly an option.

<p>
In addition to not being a psychologist, I am also still not as uninterruptible as Donald
Knuth. My role may not be to be on the bottom of things, but I also don't need to be on top
of things. I need to be somewhere in the middle, taking in the latest information that is
meaningful to me, but spending enough time in the depths of my real work and studies so as
to not have my mental capacities turn to mush.
