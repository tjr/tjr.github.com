In February of 2006, Lori Neirynck, who then worked one office over from mine
and has a pending <a href="http://www.oakland.edu/enp/e.addenda.html">Erdos 
number of 2</a>, asked me if I would be interested in photographing a flyball competition.  My response? "Sure, what's flyball?"
</p>

<p>
If you find yourself in a similar situation, perhaps you will learn something
useful from my experience.
</p>

<h3>Indoors or Outdoors?</h3>

<p>
Flyball competitions may be held either indoors or outdoors.  You will find
that most good flyball photographs were taken at outdoor events.  Even in
a reasonably well-lit room, the dogs are moving so very fast that you need
yet more light, a faster lens, higher ISO, or all three.
</p>

<p>

In my case, I was indoors, so I had to surmount the technical difficulties.
If you are shooting outdoors with the bright sun among your assets, then your
job will be much easier from a
camera equipment perspective, and you can spend more time getting interesting
shots.  Most of this article assumes you are indoors.
</p>


<h3>Selecting a Camera</h3>

<p>
You probably already have a camera, but if not, then you will want a digital
SLR camera.  I use Canons, and for this intense of photography, you will
probably want to too.  As of October 2006, Canon cameras offer higher-quality
digital sensors than most other brands of digital SLRs.
</p>

<p>
Canon introduces new models of DSLRs about every six months, and they keep
getting better.  I use the 5D right now, and am very happy with it.  For
fast sports like this, other models offering more frames per second of shooting
may be preferable, but the 5D has excellent image quality in high ISO settings,
which is also important.
</p>

<p>
What about film SLRs?  Sure, that'd be fine, especially if you know what you're
doing.  I took about a thousand photographs at the competition, and one-third
of them or more were completely useless...  out-of-focus, blurred, nothing
interesting in the shot, etc., etc.  At current prices, it would have cost
$250 or more just to buy and develop the film, and I couldn't have had
real-time previews of my pictures to make adjustments.
</p>

<p>
Whichever route you go, I will continue writing here from a Canon perspective.
Other manufacturers (especially Nikon) may have similar equipment available.
</p>


<h3>Selecting a Lens</h3>

<p>
Since you can't get right in the track with the dogs most of the time, you
will need a lens that is moderately long, and as fast as possible.  I would
say no shorter than 85mm, and probably no longer than 200mm, on a full-frame
camera.  Hey, well,
Canon makes a nice 70-200/2.8 zoom lens.  How about that?
</p>

<p>
Probably a fair choice, and that's a good lens for many other purposes as
well.  It will definitely cover our expected range of focal lengths.  But
is it fast enough?  Maybe not.  Remember, we need to freeze the furry action
on dashing dogs indoors.  Let's consider some other options from Canon.

</ul>

<p>
Plus the 70-200/2.8 zoom lens, of course, which runs about $1800 for the
image-stabilization version and $1150 for the non-IS version.
</p>

<p>
(If you're using a cropped DSLR, like the Canon 30D with its 1.6x crop, then
you could safely take the 200mm off the list at the long end and add the
50mm/1.4 or 50mm/1.2 at the short end, as 50mm on the 30D looks like 80mm
on a full-frame camera.)
</p>

<p>
Well, the 200mm prime lens has a maximum aperture of 2.8, just like the
zoom lens, so that's not going to help us get any faster than the zoom.
Therefore, no reason to buy that, unless you're sure you want 200mm and
don't want the extra weight or price of the zoom lens.  The 85mm lenses would
actually be good
choices if you think you can get in close enough.  I wasn't sure that I could,
so I opted to not get those.  After shooting at the event, though, I think
that 85mm could have been very useful.  I would have set up my shots
differently than I did, but I could have still gotten good shots.
</p>

<p>
For similar reasons, wanting to make sure I had enough length, I also
dismissed the 100mm/2 lens, and went for the 135mm/2.

</p>

<p>
So why prefer, say, the 135mm/2 over the 70-200/2.8 zoom?  It's faster, so
you can shoot with a faster shutter speed in less light.  "But you can get
the zoom with image stabilzation!"  Sure.  You'll probably want to be on a
tripod anyway,  making IS useless.  More on that later.
</p>

<p>
In short, any of the lenses mentioned here (maybe even the zooms, but I wouldn't
depend on them) would be a good choice.
</p>


<h3>Flash</h3>

<a href="/photos/20060610-flyball-04/IMG_2187.jpg">
<img src="/images/20060610-flyball-04/thumbnails/IMG_2187.jpg"
class="photo" align="right"></a>

<p>
No flash allowed in flyball competitions.  Sorry.  However, the brighter
you can get the lighting indoors, the better off you'll be.  If you have
the time and inclination, you might try asking the competition administrators
if you could set up some additional lighting specifically for your photographic
efforts.  It might be a big fuss to set the lighting up and move it around
with you, but on the other hand it could make your job as a photographer
substantially easier.
</p>


<h3>Tripod</h3>

<p>
Yes, yes, yes.  I quickly realized that I could neither hold the camera still
enough nor get the dogs in focus well enough while handholding the camera.  So
I plopped it onto a tripod, prefocused at a spot where the dogs would be as
they ran, and fired away using a remote shutter control.  You will almost
certainly want to do the same.  What kind of tripod?  Anything sturdy enough
to hold your camera with lens should be fine.  You're going to be indoors,
so you don't need to worry about wind or falling down a hill.
</p>

<p>
What about image stabilization?  That might fix the camera shake, but you
still have to focus on a certain spot.  Autofocus just isn't fast enough to
track the dog as it runs full-speed.  Now, on the other hand, there's a good
chance that you're going to misfire the shutter release on half of the
shots anyway, so you could just prefocus, standstill, and shoot with IS and
potentially end up with similar results.  But since the only suitable lenses
with IS have a maximum aperture of only 2.8, and you can get a good prime with
a maximum aperture of 2.0 or faster, you'll probably want to forget the IS
lens and set up a tripod.
</p>

<p>

Except when you're not shooting the dogs in action.
</p>

<p>
I urge you to not just set up along the track and shoot a thousand pictures
of dogs running along the track and then pack up and go home.  Grab your fast
prime lens, or even your 70-200/2.8 zoom, and wander around the competition
area.  Yeah, you'll miss some shots on the track, but you'll also come up
with lots of good candid portraits of people, dogs, and people with dogs.  You
may find that these photographs are better received and higher quality than
the on-the-track photos that you spent so much time and equipment on to get
right.
</p>


<h3>ISO and Shutter Settings</h3>

<a href="/photos/20060610-flyball-06/IMG_2716.jpg">
<img src="/images/20060610-flyball-06/thumbnails/IMG_2716.jpg"
class="photo" align="right"></a>

<p>
ISO: as high as reasonable.  Shutter speed:  as slow as you can without
blurring the image.
</p>

<p>
I ended up shooting at ISO 3200 on my Canon 5D for most of the action shots,
at the maximum aperture of f2.0, and a shutter speed just short of causing the
image to blur, and it <i>still</i> wasn't fast enough to capture high-quality
photos of the running dogs.  If you're using a faster lens, then you maybe be
able to get by with lower ISO or faster shutter speed, either of which would
improve the overall photo quality.  Watch out for unacceptably shallow depth
of field, though, as you increase the aperture.
</p>


<h3>The Bottom Line</h3>

<p>
Indoor flyball photography is very equipment-intensive.  You'll need a high
quality digital SLR (or a high-quality film SLR with lots of experience using
it), a fast medium-telephoto lens, and a tripod with shutter remote.  You'll
need to be alert to what's going on, in order to fire the shutter remote at
just the right time.
</p>

<p>

You will probably also want to take along a second body with a normal or wide 
angle
lens for capturing moments at the competition that are a little less intense
than the racing itself.  One of the favorite photos from my flyball shoot
ended up being a photo of the entire arena taken with a 15mm fisheye lens,
on an EOS-3 camera with Fuji NPH 400 film.  Be creative.  Have fun.  You might
even be inspired to spend a little more time with your dog.
