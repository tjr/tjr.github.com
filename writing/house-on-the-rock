    What happens when an aspiring architect builds an unusual little house, starts accepting paying visitors, and uses the proceeds to make the house continually more unusual and less little? One possible outcome is Alex Jordan's House on the Rock in Spring Green, Wisconsin.
     
While in its current form, the House on the Rock is more of a sprawling theme park than a house, it truly did begin life as the oddly-designed, vaguely Oriental, vaguely Frank Lloyd Wright-esque home of Mr. Jordan. Modern-day visitors can explore the original house in the first part of the tour, but what is most memorable is the large, eccentric collections of themed objects...
 	 The world's largest carousel.
 	 The machine room, full of many large and extravagant mechanical creations.
 	 "Octopus's Garden", part of the oceanic exhibit which includes a remarkably huge model of a whale.
 	 A rather large pipe organ. (Note the equally rather large organ pipes in the background.) I suspect that this isn't entirely functional, if at all, but it was a stunning spectacle either way.
 	 There are many mechanical creations into which you can put a 25-cent token and watch/hear/interact with in some way. Not all of them struck me as worth bothering with. Perhaps the most interesting are the musical instruments which seem to play themselves, though I later read that at least some of the music is prerecorded, making the automated maestros less impressive...
 	 Decor of Oriental influence can be found throughout.
Why?
Why do all of this? I think that to get people asking that question was one of the reasons behind it all. A few photographs can give some idea of what this place is like, but to really understand the over-the-top excessiveness found here, you probably just have to see it in person.
For Camera Nerds
Lighting leans heavily toward the dark side, so bring a good flash for your camera or (preferably) a very fast lens. I used a f2.8 zoom lens, and was wishing for a faster f1.4 prime...
Fried Cheese Curds
Somewhere in the depths of this place there is a little cafeteria, which serves up, among other things, the best fried cheese curds I've ever had.
