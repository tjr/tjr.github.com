    <h2>A Trip to the Iowa Youth Llama Festival</h2>

    <p>
In September 2005, Jennifer and I took a trip to Eldora, Iowa, to attend
the Iowa Youth Llama Festival.  Jennifer had seen this event advertised
in our local newspaper, and, knowing that I was fond of llamas (ever since
I played the Infocom computer game
<a href="http://www.csd.uwo.ca/Infocom/bureaucracy.html">Bureacracy</a>),
she suggested that we go.
</p>

<p>
When we arrived in Eldora,
we were greeted by a surprisingly small number of people with a comparitively
large number of llamas.  No corn dogs or ferris wheels or other typical "festival things"
in sight.  Just a run-down race track of some sort, and a small park across the street.
Most of the llama events appeared to be taking place in a couple of barns near the abandoned
race track.

</p>

<h3>The Llama Show</h3>

<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/dV2_mqOQWoG1_bOWDG1GdA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_IsIl4HvOgJw/R3cZcg_08OI/AAAAAAAABSs/CNSUn76UYf8/s288/IMG_0133.jpg" class="photo" align="right"/></a>

<p>

We quickly found that a llama show was going on in one of the barns, so we joined
the audience and watched as Iowa youth showed their llamas.  It was a lot like a
dog show, only with llamas instead of dogs.  The owners brought their llamas into the barn
and walked around, then stopped and waited for judges to rate the appearance
and behavior of the llamas.
</p>

<p>
The final event in the llama show was an opportunity for the especially young youth
to show their llamas.  As this concluded, one of the announcers said they were going
to break for lunch.  I got my hopes up for the corn dogs, but all I saw was people
with sack lunches.  Alas.
</p>

<p>

We wandered into the second barn where the many of the llamas were relaxing in pens.
Eager photographer that I am, I just started taking pictures, but Jennifer was
concerned that the llamas might not like that.  (I was too excited photographing
real, live llamas to be prudent.)  We walked over to some llama owners and asked
if they thought the llamas would mind being photographed.  They said no, that this
shouldn't bother them.  (Whew.)
</p>

<p>

So we continued to walk around the barn, taking photographs of llamas.  We came upon
a llama that was wearing some sort of
<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/5EL0Rq-XwOPLHWjPpeRMWA?feat=directlink">black
body suit</a>; I assumed that the llama was
undergoing medical treatment of some sort.  While taking pictures of a nearby llama,
a man called out from amidst his lunch that we could pet it if we wanted to.
</p>

<p>
It turned out that this man and his family owned several of the llamas, including
the one in the black body suit, and his twin daughters were youth contestants in the
festival.  It also turned out that there was more to the black body suit that met the
eye.
</p>

<h3>The Costume Competition</h3>

<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/EAOiXB2YM4IOHSXjUZ7OTg?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_IsIl4HvOgJw/R3catg_08zI/AAAAAAAABXs/dMIgjHMfcfg/s288/IMG_0178.jpg" class="photo" align="right"/></a>

<p>
As it turned out, this llama in the black body suit was not undergoing medical
treatment, but rather was in preparatory stages of wearing a costume for the next
competition at the festival.  I had no idea llama costume competitions took place.

</p>

<p>
I'm still not entirely sure what this particular llama was supposed to be dressed up
as, but I am quite certain that the other of their llamas in the contest was dressed
up as Barbara Eden in <i>I Dream of Jeannie</i>.  "Wait until we get the head-dress
on!" we were instructed, as the mother and one of the daughters started putting a
bright pink gown onto the llama.

</p>

<p>
I asked if the llamas were bothered by having costumes on.  "Oh yes, they hate it,"
our llama informant told us.  He went on to explain that if the handlers can keep
the llamas under control even when the animals are so very bothered by the costumes,
then they must really be doing a good job.  This effect is magnified when the llamas
are wearing something covering their head, hence, I presume, the unexpected interest
in llama head-dresses.
</p>

<p>

We thanked the family for sharing with us, and continued wandering around the barn.
More and more llamas were being prepared for the costume competition.  One was being
disguised as a scarecrow ("Wait until we get the head-dress on!" I was instructed
again, while taking a photograph of the partially-disguised llama), another as
science fiction villian Darth Vader, and another as a clown (although we firmly
believe that this particular llama refused to accept the fact that he was, indeed,
dressed up as a clown).
</p>

<p>

As the costume contest was about to begin, I waited outside in between the two
barns, to get good closeup shots of the llamas as they walked from the "backstage"
barn to the "competition hall".  As I got a picture of the Darth Vader llama,
the llama, who likely couldn't see very well, jerked his head in the general direction
of my very quiet-but-evidently-not-quiet-enough digital camera.  His young handler
also looked in my direction, and didn't appear particularly happy.  I hoped that I
hadn't messed up the llama's concentration, and quickly ducked back into the
main barn.
</p>

<p>
And so the costume competition began.  We saw more great llama costumes, and along
with them, their handlers were also wearing costumes that went along with whatever
the llamas were weall too
soon.  But that wasn't the end of the festival.  While I was hanging out in between
the two barns before the costume competition, I met an older man who was rummaging
around in a pile of bars and pipes leaning up against a wall.  He explained that he
had been involved with llamas for a number of years, and asked how I heard about
the festival.  I told him about the newspaper article, which he asked to see.
</p>

<p>

I offered to help him with whatever he was doing with the bars and pipes, but he
declined my offer.  I later came to find out that he was assembling equipment for
the llama obstacle course.
</p>

<h3>Llamas Hate Water</h3>

Llamas hate water, we were told, so naturally part of the obstacle course included leading
the llamas through a small pool of water. Other aspects of the obstacle course included a bar
to jump over, a hoop to jump through, and a tunnel with sparkly strands of sparkly stuff
covering the entrance and exit. (Llamas also hate sparkly stuff.) 
</p>

<p>
After watching a fair bit of the obstacle course, we decided that we had seen enough llamas,
took enough photographs, and it was time to go.  Before we left, I thanked the man
who had told us so much about the llamas.  He warned
me, "You're going to miss the best part of the obstacle course, when we bring out
the teeter-totters!"  In retrospect, I wish we had stayed to see that, but oh well.
</p>

<p>

Maybe next year.
