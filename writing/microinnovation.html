<p>
<a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> has become immensely successful over
the past several years producing a bunch of web applications that already existed.
Google brought us web search.  We already had <a href="http://www.altavista.com/">

web search</a>.  Google brought us online maps.  We already had
<a href="http://www.mapquest.com/">online maps</a>.  Google brought us web-based
email.  We already had <a href="http://www.hotmail.com/">web-based email</a>.
</p>

<p>
How in the world, then, has Google become so successful?  How could a technology
company that doesn't appear to have innovated anything attract the attention of
so many users and investors?  In a word, <i>microinnovation</i>.

</p>

<p>
So far, Google has not shown many signs of macroinnovation; they haven't come up
with a product or service that is extremely unlike anything ever seen before.  But
this doesn't mean they aren't innovative.  On the contrary, they are extremely
innovative, but at a level that usually isn't thought of as such.
</p>


<h3>Stop Worrying and Love the Webmail Interface</h3>

<p>
For years I was a fan of desktop client-based email software.  My favorite interface
was the email tool in Netscape 4.  After I finally figured out that Netscape 4 wasn't
the web browser to use any more, I got accustomed to the email tool in Mozilla, and
eventually <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/thunderbird/">Thunderbird</a>.  I had used
webmail a bit, but really didn't care for it.  Sure, it would be great if I could
access my email from any computer on the Internet, but that convenience was minor
in comparison to having an interface that I found pleasing.
</p>

<p>
Then, one day, I got an email from Google, inviting me to try out

<a href="http://www.gmail.com/">Gmail</a>.  I signed up, tinkered with it for a few
moments, and set my attention on finding out how to access the account via POP3.
This turned out to be possible, so I added my GMail account to my Thunderbird setup,
and retired to the kitchen for a donut.
</p>

<p>
Wanting to read my personal mail at work, I later decided to spend more time with
the Gmail web interface.  The more time I spent with it, the less I found myself using
Thunderbird.  This isn't because I no longer think highly of Thunderbird; on the contrary,
it's a wonderful product.  (I do still use it for intranet newsgroup access.)  But the pleasantness
of the Gmail web interface, along with the convenience of having all of my email
accessible from whatever computer I am using, simply leaves me with no need nor
desire to download email locally any more.
</p>

<h3>Digging Deeper</h3>

<p>
So what was the difference?  Why would I leave Thunderbird for Gmail's web interface
when I wouldn't for any of the other webmail providers?  Microinnovation.  Gmail is
yet another webmail service.  I can log into a website, read my mail, send new mail,
store email addresses, filter spam...  all of this can be found on any decent webmail
service.  Ah, but Google took it further.  They provided a lot of storage space.
(Others are catching up now, but Google was one of the first.)  They provided good
searching and sorting capabilities for your email.  They provided a super-clean,
Ajax/Javascript-enhanced user interface that was a joy to use.  And they did it all
free of charge, with tasteful, content-directed advertising.
</p>

<p>

None of those points are huge.  Any of them could have been implemented (at least
to some extent) long before Google entered the webmail scene.  They aren't stunning
breakthroughs in computer science research.  They are innovations in computer-human
interface design and software engineering, executed very nicely.
</p>

<p>
But these small ideas, applied to a macroinnovation like webmail, add up quickly,
enabling yet another webmail service to become something truly special and unique.
Google didn't change the core webmail service; they dug down deeper to find
relatively tiny areas that they could seriously improve, and those improvements
all work together to make Gmail one of the best webmail providers available today.

<h3>Just the Chicken Sandwich</h3>

<p>
Microinnovation isn't limited to computer technology.
<a href="http://www.eatmorechicken.com/">Chick-fil-A</a> has the slogan,
"We Didn't Invent The Chicken, Just The Chicken Sandwich".  The chicken is a
macroinnovation, while the chicken sandwich is a microinnovation.  A nice
roasted chicken may be a great meal, but a chicken sandwich is in many ways
better.  It's more portable.  It doesn't require a knife or fork to eat it
with.  At Chick-fil-A, it includes a slice of pickle.  I don't think I've
ever seen a roasted chicken come with a slice of pickle.
</p>

<p>
Many product developers have essentially stopped coming up with totally new
products, but continue to improve upon existing ones.
<a href="http://www.canon.com/">Canon</a> has been producing cameras for
decades, and they tend to introduce several new models each year.  What do
people say when they see a new model?  Do they say, "Oh, wow, dude!  A fancy
new machine for storing images by way of recording rays of light!"  No.  They
point out, "Oh, wow, dude!  This new model has twenty-one auto-focus points, while
last year's model only had seven!"  They aren't impressed by the fact that it's
a camera, and rightly so.  The camera isn't an innovation.  
</p>

<p>
Auto-focus points aren't
innovations either, since they were evidently on last year's model.  What might be
an innovation is that Canon came up with a way to provide twenty-one autofocus
points for the same cost that seven were priced at last year.  Microinnovation.
Canon has been one of the top suppliers of prosumer photography equipment for a long
time, and show no signs of letting up, even though their core products -- cameras,
lenses, flashes -- are the same core products they were making twenty years ago.
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>
So what can we learn from Google?  A good product idea isn't necessarily a totally new
product idea.  If you've ever been using something, be it a web service, a camera,
or a chicken, and thought to yourself, "this would be a lot better if...", then you
may very well have a microinnovation that could lead to an improved version of
that product.  It might take more than one such microinnovation to really make a go
of it.  A roasted chicken with a slice of pickle isn't going to sail much further
than a roasted chicken without a slice of pickle.
