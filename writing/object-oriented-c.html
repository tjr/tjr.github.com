<h3><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h3>

<p>
I find myself converting old Ada software to C (for business, not pleasure), and
many memories of my times spent with C have resurfaced.  I'm a bit wiser now, as Lisp
makes a software engineer wise, and thought that I should take some time to jot
down some basic ideas about building object-oriented software using C.  Whether if you
are building new C software from scratch, or rebuilding some old software afresh in
C, I hope that this little guide will prove beneficial for you.  I will continue to
add to it as I think of things to add.  Comments and corrections are welcome
via email.
</p>

<h3><a name="objects">Objects and Classes</a></h3>

<p>
C is not an object-oriented language.  You might rightly wonder, then, how can we
build object-oriented software using C?  The best answer to this question is, of
course, is that you should use C++ or Java or some other language better suited to
the problem you need to solve, but this is not always an option.
</p>

<p>
Since C has no built-in support for objects, we will have to make do with what it
<i>does</i> offer.  The closest thing to the C++ <tt>class</tt> that we have in
C is a structure.  Here's an example of one:
</p>

<pre>
struct cameraShot
{
  int filmSpeed;
  int focalLength;
  float aperture;
  float shutterSpeed;
  char description[100];
};
</pre>

<p>
This defines a new type called <tt>struct cameraShot</tt>, and is kind of like
a class.  We can now make new variables that are "instances" of this type, and
are kind of like objects:
</p>

<pre>
struct cameraShot petLlamaInHelicopter =
  {400, 135, 2.8, 0.01, "My pet llama on board a helicopter."};

struct cameraShot petLlamaSurfing = 
  {800, 300, 2.8, 0.01, "My pet llama surfing in southern California."};
</pre>

<p>
We can easily write functions that operate on these objects.  We can't declare
the function <i>inside of</i> the structure, so we have to pass a pointer to
an instance of the structure as a parameter to the functions:
</p>

<pre>
int getFilmSpeed (struct cameraShot *cs)
{
  return cs->filmSpeed;
}
</pre>

<p>
That wasn't really <i>that</i> bad, was it?  Let's take a look at a few more:
</p>

<pre>
void setFilmSpeed (struct cameraShot *cs, int filmSpeed)
{
  cs->filmSpeed = filmSpeed;
}
</pre>

<pre>
void setDescription (struct cameraShot *cs, char *description)
{
  strcpy (cs->description, description);
}
</pre>

<p>
It's a little bit messier than C++, but not a lot.  The big problem you 
are likely to run into is with the function names.  In C++, a function
like <tt>setFilmSpeed</tt> would be hidden inside the class definition,
tucked away into its own little namespace.  In C, it's a global function
declaration that potentially could be seen by the rest of the program.  You
can't have more than one function named <tt>setFilmSpeed</tt>, so you'll
probably want to be a little more clever with your naming conventions to
ensure that you won't trample on a fellow programmer's identifiers, nor
he on yours.
</p>

<h3><a name="generic">Generic Programming</a></h3>

<p>
C is not a very good language for generic (a.k.a., template) programming.  If
you're familiar with templates in C++ or generics in Java or Ada, or if you've
simply been coding in Lisp your whole life and don't think much about types at
all, then you might find yourself stumped at how to perform some of your cool
coding techniques in C.
</p>

<p>
The traditional way in which C pretends to offer generic programming is through
void pointers.
A void pointer can be used to point to any kind of data object C.  That's the
good news.  The bad news is that in order to really use the data object, you
still have to know the type of the object.  There are some limited things you
can do with the data without knowing its type, but somewhere down the line,
unless you're just moving raw data around, you're going to have to know the
type.
</p>

<p>
If you only have to deal with a finite (and preferably small) number of
possible types for your generic, then you can get away with having the
function accept a void pointer along with some sort of type indicator.
For example:
</p>

<pre>
enum genericTypes {integer, floatingPoint};

void addNumbers (void * first, void * second, enum genericTypes type)
{
  if (type == integer)
  {
    int *a = (int*)first;
    int *b = (int*)second;
    *a = *a + *b;
  }
  else if (type == floatingPoint)
  {
    float *a = (float*)first;
    float *b = (float*)second;
    *a = *a + *b;
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
Whew.  That'd be tedious for complex operations with many possible types, but it
could be done.
</p>

<h3><a name="more">Additional Resources</a></h3>

<p>
Much has been written about C.  Not a whole lot of in-depth material about C
has made it's way to the World Wide Web, probably because most programmers really
do cry when they think about C, and lack motivation to write about it for free
distribution.  Nevertheless, here are some sources you might find useful, both
online and in hardcopy:
