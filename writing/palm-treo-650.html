<h1>Review of the Palm Treo 650</h1>

<p>
Several weeks ago, I got a new cellular telephone in the form of a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treo_650">Palm Treo
650</a>. This device has many more features out of the box than my
previous cellular phone did (an LG phone that likely came free with
the phone service), and, while offering many nifty benefits also has a
few downsides.

<h2>What's Good?</h2>

It's a computer! Hooray. So is any mobile phone on the market
today. But, running PalmOS, it's a little more obvious on the Treo
650. I can easily download software, either directly on the phone or
on my desktop computer, that can run on the phone. I can synchronize
contact lists, calendar entries, and text memos between the phone and
my desktop computer. I can type on the minature QWERTY keyboard on the
phone. As far as computers go, it's reasonably capable.
<p>
Along with the Treo 650, I now have mobile internet access. I could
have had this with my previous phone, but I didn't; either way, I
think I can make better use of it on the Treo than on a lesser
phone. The Treo comes with a respectable mobile web browser, with
which I can (occasionally with some inconvenience) access both
<a href="http://www.google.com/pda">mobile-specific web sites</a> and
traditional web sites. JavaScript even works on the Treo's browser,
permitting usage of Ajax-enhanced sites.
<p>
I also found and installed an <a href="http://www.tussh.com">SSH
client</a> that runs on the PalmOS. The font is tiny, but the program
functional. I can now log into my GNU/Linux server accounts whilst
hanging out at the shopping mall, if I so desire!
<p>
A POP3/IMAP email client is included with the Treo 650, which lets me
download my latest messages from GMail wherever I'm at. (Google
introduced the mobile version of GMail just after I got my Treo email
client set up; this turns out to be much easier to use than the Treo
client.) You can specifiy whether or not to download attachments with
email, or just attachments under a particular size. You can also add
attachments to outgoing emails; for example, pictures that you take
with the onboard digital camera.
<p>
The digital camera on the Treo 650 isn't as spectacular as a Canon
digital SLR, but I didn't really expect that. It's also nowhere near
as good as my old 2.2 megapixel Hewlett Packard digital camera, but I
didn't really expect that either. But it's still nice to have a
functional camera built into your phone, for those times when you
aren't toting a Canon SLR with you.

<h2>What's Bad?</h2>
After several years of getting used to a regular mobile phone, there
are a few things I notice about the Treo 650 that aren't all that
great. Or, at least, things that I miss from my previous mobile
phones.
<p>
First is the clock that's always on the cover of the phone. Many
mobile phones have this, and you don't have to activate the phone in
any way to see the clock. The Treo 650 is in some sort of blacked-out
screensaver mode when it's not in use, so even if you didn't have it
inside of a protective holster, you still couldn't see the clock
without awakening the Treo. Of course, there are these things called
wristwatches, and I almost always wear one when not asleep, and there
are these things called alarm clocks which I almost always have near
my bed. Nevertheless, there are a few occasions (e.g., travelling
without an alarm clock) when the phone-face timepiece is handy.
<p>
Second, the Treo 650 isn't very telephone shaped. I don't know if I
just have an unusually large face or what, but it can be difficult to
position the Treo near my head such that I can hear well through the
earpiece and the person with whom I am talking can hear my voice
through the microphone. I do prefer using a headset for lengthy
conversations, but this condundrum of phone placement still pops up
from time to time. I guess I just need to talk louder or listen
harder.
<p>
Lastly, the Treo 650 is, well, a computer running a reasonably capable
operating system. While this is largely a good thing (at least for
software developers like me), it also means that the phone is more
prone to experiencing a total system meltdown than lesser phones. Mine
has crashed several times over the past few weeks, but thankfully not
whilst talking on. The crashes occurred while trying to setup
Bluetooth wireless connections with my desktop computer, and trying to
run new software that evidently doesn't work all that great on the
Treo 650.

<h2>Summary</h2>

I like the Treo 650. It's not flawless and perfect in every way, but
the minor quibbles I have with it are outweighed by its other
usefulness and good design. At About $350, it's not the cheapest
mobile phone on the market, but you get what you pay for. And if you
like the idea of having a pocket computer with mobile internet access
and the ability to place telephone calls, then a Treo 650 may be for
you.

<h2>Update: Palm Treo 700w</h2>

About a month after I wrote this review, Palm released
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treo_700w">Treo 700w</a>. In
true computer technology form, my spiffy new mobile smartphone is now
yesterday's news. Oh well. I'm still happy with it, and don't plan on
upgrading to the 700w any time soon. In fact, by the time I'm ready
for a new phone, we'll probably see another revision or two come
along. The Palm Treo 700w features an unexpected twist from Palm: it
runs Microsoft Windows Mobile.

<h2>Update: Whack-a-Palm</h2>

It's been about nine months now since I got my Palm Treo 650. A few
weeks ago, it started not responding to button presses. The
touchscreen still worked, but this was largely useless because I have
to press a physical button to unlock the phone and place a call. If
someone calls me, then the phone is automatically unlocked, and I can
use the touchscreen at that point.
<p>
I was about to have it replaced when it suddenly started working
again. Then, a few days later, it stopped working. Then it started
working. Then it stopped working. Once, removing and reinserting the
SD memory card revived functionality; another time, giving the Treo a
good whack brought it back. Other times, nothing I do seems to help.
<p>
This has happened enough now that I will probably replace it, even if
it does mysteriously start working again. I'm somewhat hesitent to
replace it with another Palm Treo after seeing this, but we'll see
what happens.

<h2>Update: Getting Better?</h2>

The folks at Sprint said two things: they should be able to get me a
replacement Treo, but with the new 700 model out now, it would take
them a while to hunt down another 650; and I should try removing and
replacing the battery about once a week and see if my problems go
away.
<p>
It's been about a month since they began their quest to find me a
replacement, and I haven't heard back from them. I suppose that they
aren't very keen on the idea of replacing my Treo 650 with a Treo 700
unless I pay for it, so they would rather procure another
650. Removing and replacing the battery seems to largely do away with
the problem, although not entirely.

<h2>Update: My New Refurbished Treo</h2>

The phone continued to fail sporadically, and the Sprint store found
me a "factory refurbished" Treo 650. I went into the store to pick it
up, and while the clerk was in the back getting the box, I pulled out
my old phone and turned it on. To my amazement, it didn't work. I was
amazed because I would finally have the opportunity to show the Sprint
staff the phone in a defunct state.
<p>
The clerk returned, and I handed the old phone to her and demonstrated
the problem. She looked at it, from my perspective in surprise, and
said, "It doesn't work." I wondered if they hadn't believed me until
they actually saw it fail.
<p>
No matter, they assigned my old phone number to the refurbished phone,
and handed it to me. I've owned this new phone for about thirty
minutes now. So far, so good...

<h2>Update: Another Refurbished Treo</h2>

Well, it turned out that the refurbished Treo I had been given
initially mostly worked, but was unable to connect to the
Internet. Since web use was one of the main reasons I wanted a Treo in
the first place, this warranted some looking into.
<p>
I took the Treo to the Sprint store (a different Sprint store this
time, just out of convenience), and the clerk looked at it and waited
on hold for Sprint technical support and talked with Sprint technical
support for about an hour and a half altogether. The end result was
that I should get a replacement Treo.
<p>
As before, Sprint preferred to rustle up a refurbished 650 model
rather than give me a newer model. They had more difficulty finding
one now than before, but managed to come up with one. This time,
before leaving the store with the new refurbished Treo, we verified
that the phone service worked and the Internet service worked.
<p>
I'm currently on day three of this new Treo 650. Again I say, so far
so good...
