succeed in any field, you more or less need to do 10,000 hours of
specific practice. The details of this claim can be debated, but I
believe the premise is sound: we improve at our ability to do
something largely by practicing it.

<p>
As software engineers, how much are we practicing?

<p>
I have been working as a professional software engineer for about
eight years now.  Assuming working 46 weeks out of the year at 30
hours a week (subtracting hours for non-technical staff meetings and
dental appointments and what-not), that puts me at having accomplished
a little over 11,000 hours of software engineering work.

<p>
Wow! I must be a pretty accomplished software engineer. But what
exactly have I been practicing? My work has been all over the map.
I've written and edited documentation. I've done research and writeups
for product certifications. I've written automated tests. I've
performed manual tests. I've supported users. Only a fraction of my
time (maybe in the vicinity of 1/3) has been spent really, actually
writing software. That's okay, though, because all of these tasks
are part of the software engineering experience. Typing C code into
Emacs is only one aspect of the work.

<p>
But for all of that, too often when I say to myself, "I'm going
to build such-and-such software application from scratch," I feel
as if my mind has turned to mush, and get easily distracted by
shiny new links to click on the internet. I may be well-practiced
at sundry tasks as part of working on a software engineering team,
but on my own I feel woefully out of touch.

<p>
Last year, I wrote a little
<a href="http://www.trevisrothwell.com/software/lets-decide">iPhone
application</a> that implements the borda count voting algorithm.
After spending a while with family trying to decide which movie
to watch, I thought this might make a useful program to carry around
on my phone.

<p>
It took me approximately ten hours across less than a week of part-time
evenings to build this application. Yet several times I nearly gave up
and quit because I felt too mentally mushy. In theory, I knew what to do,
but I was having difficulty harnessing the focus and motivation to make
myself do it. For a ten-hour project.

<p>
That's pathetic.

<p>
But why? I remember in the not too distant past I would easily spend
hours upon hours working on similar projects, building something up
from scratch. Have I just become lazy? Stupid? What is it?

<p>
While I may have 10,000+ hours of practice time as a software engineer
in general, software development is a huge field. I do <em>not</em> yet
have 10,000 hours of practice building iPhone applications. I have done
a fair bit of consulting hours on iPhone work, but that was mostly adding
to existing software, not creating new applications from scratch all the
time.

<p>
If I want to excel at whipping out new iPhone applications, then I need
to practice creating iPhone applications. As many as possible. One or
two a year is probably not going to be sufficient. That may well put me
ahead in expertise of programmers who have never written iPhone code at
all, but in order to become proficient to the point where a small
ten-hours project doesn't seem forboding, I need to have created lots
of projects, and engrain the process into my thinking.
