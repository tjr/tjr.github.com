Future Was Here: The Commodore Amiga</a> is a new entry in
the <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/">MIT Press</a> Platform Studies
series, written by Jimmy Maher. As a former user of an Amiga 3000
computer, I have been looking forward to reading this book, which
opens with a short overview of the platform:</p>
<p>The Amiga 1000 was introduced in 1985, amid aesthetically bland and technologically limited IBM personal computers and the then-monochrome Apple Macintosh. In comparison, the Amiga offered "a palette of 4,096 colors, screen resolutions up to 640x400, four-channel digital stereo sound, true preemptive multitasking" and more.</p>

<p>Computer journalists struggled to understand just what practical
implications these sorts of new features would hold for users. Many
wrote about how the Amiga would surely advance the world of computing,
though not everyone saw the potential. "There are products now that
address every need of the business person," said computer retailer
Bert Helfinstein. "Why add another one unless there is a compelling
reason? And in [the case of the Amiga], that compelling reason doesn't
exist."</p>

<p>Maher spends the rest of the book showing us compelling reasons why
the Amiga was indeed a groundbreaking computer: "the world's first
true multimedia PC." Descriptions range from technical historical
journalism reminiscent of
classic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_%28magazine%29">Byte
magazine</a> articles, to surprisingly in-depth (yet layman-friendly)
computer science surveys to help us understand how the Amiga hardware
and software was wired together.</p>

<p>I am delighted with the level of detail and behind-the-scenes
trivia that Maher has provided. Some interesting bits that stood out
to me:</p>

<ul>
<li>The origins of the IFF file format to allow Amiga users to more
easily share data across applications</li>
<li>The selection of the name "Amiga" in order to appear before
"Apple" and "Atari" in alphabetical corporate directories</li>
<li>Inner workings of Deluxe Paint's "undo" functionality, which
explain some of its odd behavior that might not have been understood
from the surface</li>
<li>A thorough overview of the original "boing" bouncing ball demo
that kicked off the Amiga's graphics-producing fame</li>
</ul>

<p>I always knew that the Amiga platform was ahead of its time, but it
is fascinating to gain more insight into just how advanced it was, and
how clever its developers were with the resources they had to work
with.</p>

<p>There are a number of illustrations included in the book, but I
imagine it would be perfectly readable
in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007V5BVJG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=trevrothswebl-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B007V5BVJG">Kindle
format</a> as well. Also available as an
eBook <a href="http://mitpress-ebooks.mit.edu/product/future-was-here">directly
from the publisher</a>.</p>
