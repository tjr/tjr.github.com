    <p>
What does it mean to document software?  Does it mean that you should write comments
in your code that explain nontrivial algorithms?  Does it mean that you should write
a good manual for your end users?  Does it mean you should write API documentation
so that other people using your code libraries will know how to interface with them?
Does it mean that you should write software design descriptions so that someone updating
your code or converting it to another language ten years down the road can learn what
you were thinking when you built your masterpiece?
</p>

<p>
Yes!
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, documentation as a whole is often seen as an afterthought: something
to be tacked on to a software project at the last minute, if at all.  End user
manuals are usually available in some form or another, but rarely are put together
well.  API documentation is frequently terse, but at least it exists.  Comments
and design descriptions tend to suffer the most, as the design thoughts and
rationale for the software are obvious to the developer, and, so he or she thinks,
would be obvious to anyone else as well.
</p>


<h3>User Manuals</h3>

<p>
Some software is so simple or so beautifully and intuitively designed that a manual
would be truly redundant.  This is rare.  More often, the software is sufficiently
complex and full of less than obvious functionality that a user needs help figuring out what
to do.
</p>

<p>
The first question to ask yourself as you prepare a new user manual is, who is your
target audience?  This will be in part determined by what kind of software you are
documenting, but not entirely.  Adobe Photoshop, for example, is a very large
and complex software application that costs several hundred dollars; certainly only the
most computer savvy among us would be using it, right?

</p>

<p>

Maybe not.  While Photoshop certainly does appeal to computer savvy graphics artists,
there are lots of professional and semi-professional photographers who have spent
decades using film cameras only to find themselves lost in a world of digital
technology.  These users may need a more gentle introduction to the software, with
special focus on the parts of the application that are most pertinent to them.
</p>

<p>
Of course, if you're documenting a big software product like Adobe Photoshop, then
there is a whole other industry built around writing third-party documentation for
your software.  All you have to do is provide comprehensive reference material that
only a computer graphics nerd could understand, and wait around while other people
produce easy-to-ready manuals geared for film photographers.
</p>

<p>
Either way, you still have a target audience.  There may be more than one target
audience.  You might write one manual for computer novices to learn from and
another manual for late-shift cola-slurping nerds to inhale.  Explicitly identifying
your target audience helps you narrow down what you can expect the reader to already
know.  A computer novice might need help learning how to right-click on buttons,
whereas a nerd might be offended to have to wade through such material.  A computer
novice might need help learning how to install and launch your application, whereas
a nerd might might be installing a new beta-version operating system on another computer
while reading your manual.
</p>

<p>
After you settle on your target audience, next ask yourself, what do I need to tell
the reader about this application?  Your reader might be wanting to know, what is this
software good for?  What will it do for me?  And you need to explain such things.  You
might write a section of background information, explaining the purpose of the software
and why it was built.  You might want to include a section that lists and briefly
describes the core features of the software.
</p>

<p>
If your software is a fancy, feature-filled version of some lesser product, then you
should make sure to explain what makes it better.  You don't need to list other lesser
products by name (leave that up to the nice folks in marketing), but make it clear to
whoevestandards</li>

</ul>

<p>
...and infinitely more.
</p>


<h3>Software Design Descriptions</h3>

<p>
An overall design description of the software is perhaps the most frequently
ignored form of software documentation, yet very important.  A design description
should include:
</p>

<ul>

<li>The high-level overview.  What does this software do, and why do we care?  Someone
reading this part of the documentation should have a good idea of what functionality
the software provides to its users.  If they couldn't figure out why the software
would be useful to someone based on reading this, then you haven't written enough.</li>

<br>
<li>Organizational details.  How is this software broken up into modules of code,
and what does each module do?  (And why do we care)?  Someone reading this part of
the documentation should be able to answer the question, "what would happen to
this software if we removed module X?"  If they couldn't answer that question, then
you haven't written enough about it.</li>

<br>
<li>Programmer issues.  What operating system(s), compiler(s), and programming
languages were originally
used to make this software?  What libraries are required to build it?  Were there
any design or implementation compromises made because of limitations in the operating
system, compiler, programming language, or libraries?  Someone reading this part of
the documentation would have a good idea of what would be required to rebuild the
software or to port it to a new operating system, programming language, etc.</li>

<br>
<li>References to other pertintent documentation.  You can't be expected to redocument
everything vaguely related to your software.  If there are other documents that
you or your colleagues have written that would help to explain details surrounding your
software, then refer to them so that readers can find them.</li>

</ul>

<p>
All of these details may seem glaringly obvious to you as you write the software, and
they might also be obvious to your colleagues.  But unless your software is some
throwaway hack, then part of building software that stands the test of time is documenting
it so that future maintainers or porters will be able to do their job without you.  You
may have moved on to another project, another company, or cashed in your investments
and retired.  Did you write enough about your software design so that a reasonably
intelligent newly-hired software engineer can read your documentation and pick up
where you left off?

</p>


<h3>But Documentation is Boring!</h3>

<p>
Not every programmer is fond of writing prose, but this is something you just need
to get over.  No one understands your software better than you do, so you are the best person to
write about it.  You might want to have a writing colleague handle the end user
documentation, but you should put some serious effort into anything that explains
how the software internals are wired together.
</p>

<p>
You can't write, you say?  The skill of writing documentation can be acquired.  The
two best ways to acquire it are to spend time reading well-written documentation and
to practice writing documentation.  Your first software design document might be
horrible.  Your second might be marginally better.  Your third might be kinda good.
The more you do it, the better you will get.
</p>

<p>

You might also want to invest some time in reading a book like

This ancient little masterpiece is jam-packed full of tips for improving the clarity
of your writing.
