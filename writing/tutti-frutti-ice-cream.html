<h1>In Search of Tutti Frutti Ice Cream</h1>

<p>
For over twenty years, I have been on a quest to find tutti frutti ice
cream, a flavor which has for the most part fallen off the face of the
earth. I am sharing what I have discovered with the hope that it will
be helpful to others on a similar search.

<h2>Motivation and Backstory</h2>

<p>
Around 1989, my family and I saw a rerun of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Ozzie_and_Harriet">The
Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet</a> in
which <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0870240/">Ozzie desperately
searches for tutti frutti ice cream</a>. In the 1950's, tutti frutti
ice cream was perhaps at its peak popularity, and Ozzie managed to
locate it inside of twelve hours or so (contained within a 30-minute
broadcast, of course).

<p>
<b>Watch the episode on YouTube</b>:

</ul>

<p>
I had never tasted tutti frutti ice cream. I could only imagine what it
might be like based on the descriptions in the television show. But watching
that made me want to find some tutti frutti also.

<p>
As of July 2012, I have yet to obtain any.

<h2>Origins of Tutti Frutti Ice Cream</h2>

<p>
The invention of tutti frutti ice cream has been
<a href="http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/louisville/obituary.aspx?n=charlotte-ray-motherhead-strause&pid=138210590&fhid=4753">
attributed to Roy Motherhead</a>, who ran an ice cream business in
Okolona, Kentucky through the late 1950's.  While "tutti frutti" is
Italian for "all fruit", and would make a good name for a
fruit-flavored ice cream, the flavor's name was derived from
Motherhead's daughter, who was nicknamed "Toodie".

<h2>My Findings</h2>

<p>
Shortly after watching the Ozzie and Harriet episode, we began looking
for tutti frutti ice cream in the area grocery stores around Dallas,
Texas, not turning up anything. A local ice cream manufacturer offered
to make us some tutti frutti ice cream, but they would have to make it
custom just for us, and we would need to buy five gallons of it. We
declined, thinking that five gallons would be way too much, and we'd
surely come across tutti frutti in smaller quantities if we kept
looking.

<p>
We kept looking, but did not find it. We moved to other cities across
the central United States, and every trip to a grocery store included
an obligatory scan of the ice cream section in hopes of seeing a container
of tutti frutti.

<p>
In late 1998, I happened to stumble upon some evidence that tutti frutti
was a flavor popular in India, and started contacting Indian restaurants
and grocery stores to see if they carried it.  One Indian grocer in St.
Louis explained that he used to regularly stock it in his store, but due
to lack of demand, he had just stopped ordering it. However, he would be
happy to place a special order of five gallons, provided we bought it all.
Contary to our experience in Dallas, this time we agreed.


<p>
It turned out that this ice cream was in fact labeled as "tooty
fruity", a mispelling which makes me wonder if it was authentic. Maybe
it was, maybe it wasn't, but I simply could not accept it as a
successful find. For what it's worth, worth, the "tooty fruity" had a
rather non-descript-flavored ice cream base, with bits of candied
fruit. It seemed that most of the overall flavor came from the bits of
fruit rather than the ice cream itself, and tasted not unlike a
combination of orange "Dreamsicle" ice cream bars and dried Turkish
apricots.

<p>
By now the dotCom boom was coming into full swing, and web search
engines was making finding anything in the world easier than it used
to be. I came to discover that tutti frutti was still a moderately
popular flavor in Massachusetts, though perhaps not sold under that
name.

<p>
Gary, of <a href="http://www.garysicecream.com/">Gary's Ice Cream</a>
in Chelmsford, Massachusetts, states that a flavor called "frozen
pudding" is the same as tutti frutti, only without nuts. (Tutti frutti
includes nuts, usually walnuts, Gary says.)
Gary's <a href="http://www.garysicecream.com/flavors.htm">web page</a>
describes frozen pudding as "raisins, pineapples, maraschino cherries,
apples, and peaches soaked in Meyers dark rum".

<p>
I found this out just months after a trip to Massachusetts. My next
trip there didn't occur for a number of years, but during a trip to
Boston in the fall of 2008, I continued my search. The popular
Cambridge ice cream parlor Toscanini's didn't have
it. <a href="http://www.brighams.com/flavors/default.asp?flavor=12">Brigham's</a>,
an ice cream manufacturer that provides containers of ice cream for
grocery stores and operates a number of eat-in ice cream parlors,
claims they make frozen pudding from September through December. When
I stopped in at the Brigham's parlor near
the <a href="http://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a> in
Boston, the rather grim clerk at the counter said, "It's seasonal; we
don't have any." This was October. [That Brigham's location has since
closed. Coincidence? Probably.]

<p>
I asked a native Boston tour guide about frozen pudding. He said that
some guy in his neighborhood makes it, but just closed up shop for the
winter. I spent $40 in taxi fare going to grocery stores in search of
it. Nothing. I tried several other ice cream parlors; only one person
laughed at me. I did end up getting some
tasty <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/trothwell/3192929286/">butter
pecan ice cream</a> at a shop in Harvard Square, but it just wasn't
what I was after.

<p>
I headed back home at the end of October, but only a few months later,
<a href="http://www.bostonfoodandwhine.com/">Boston Food &amp;
Whine</a> published
a <a href="http://www.bostonfoodandwhine.com/2009/02/03/brighams-frozen-pudding-ice-cream/">review
of Brigham's frozen pudding</a>! And the reviewer didn't even want to
taste it!

<p>
In January of 2012, I was in the Boston area again, but too busy to do
ice cream searching outside of my immediate area. I did check with all
of the ice cream parlors I could locate in and around Cambridge, but
none of them were making frozen pudding at that time.


<h2>Tutti Frutti Recipes</h2>

<p>
The rather authoritative-looking
textbook <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0306477009/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=trevrothswebl-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=0306477009">Ice
Cream</a></em> offers the following recipe:
<blockquote>Tutti-frutti. To 9 gal plain [ice cream] mix add 4-8 qt of
a mixture of several fruits of a suitable mixture for tutti-frutti. A
desireable mixture consists of the following fruits chopped into small
pieces: 2 qt red cherries, 2 qt green pineapple, 2 lb raisins, 2 qt
crushed pineapple, 2 lb nuts. Color light pink with red
coloring.</blockquote>  In the <em>Ozzie &amp; Harriet</em> episode,
tutti frutti was described in song as containing peaches, pineapples,
and cherries. This recipe has no mention of peaches, and does include
rasins. However, we should consider the possibility that the words of
the song were written to be more lyrical than academic, and that it is
not in fact an actual recipe.

<p>
In any event, the above recipe suggests that the flavor would come
predominantly from the bits of fruit rather than the ice cream base,
and it seems overall in line with what we learned from Gary.

<p>
A web search for tutti frutti ice cream can turn up lots more recipes,
the contents of which can vary wildly. Are any one of these recipes
more authentic than the one listed above? I have no idea. It would be
awesome to find a recipe for tutti frutti that was actually published
circa the 1950's...

<h2>Frozen Pudding Recipes</h2>

<p>
Recipes for frozen pudding seem to predate Roy Motherhead's creation
of tutti frutti by decades. For example, the following recipe was
found in <i>The Ice Book</i> by Thomas Masters, published in London
in 1844:

<blockquote>
NESSELRODE, OR FROZEN PUDDING.
<p>
Take one pint of cream, half a pint of milk, the yolks of four eggs,
one ounce of sweet almonds pounded, and half a pound of sugar; put them in
a stewpan on a gentle fire, set it as thin as custard; when cold, add two
wine-glasses of brandy and two wine-glasses of nectar, (a delicious beverage,
prepared only by the author.) Freeze, and when sufficiently congealed, add
one pound of preserved fruits, with a few currants; cut the fruit small, and
mix well with the ice, and put it into moulds, and immerse them in a freezing
mixture, such as ice and salt, &amp;c, until required for table.
</blockquote>

<p>
This doesn't appear to be exactly the same as the modern-day recipe (what is
this nectar, "prepared only by the author"?), but it certainly bears a
resemblance to what we know of as frozen pudding / tutti frutti.

In 1909, Mrs. B. B. Cutter offered the following in her book <i>Practical
Recipes</i>:

<blockquote>
FROZEN PUDDING
<p>
1 pint of rick milk,<br>
2 cups sugar,<br>
1 cup of boiled rice,<br>
2 tablespoons of gelatine,<br>
1 quart of very thick cream,<br>
1 pound of candied cherries,<br>
4 tablespoons of good sherry.
<p>
Boil the milk and thicken with rice, stirring constantly while boiling for
15 minutes; add gelatine while hot, permit it to cool before adding the sherry.
Freeze 10 minutes before adding fruit, which you stir thoroughly, then add the
cream whipped stiff. Turn out on a glass dish as you would serve ice cream.
</blockquote>

<p>
This recipe includes only cherries as fruit, and substitutes a variety of other
ingredients.

<p>
The 1844 recipe for frozen pudding also uses the name Nesselrode. A modicum of
web searching turns up that Nesselrode Pie is a historic and virtually extinct
dessert originally made with candied chestnuts and candied fruits.
<a href="http://www.thefoodmaven.com/radiorecipes/nesselrode.html">This recipe</a>
recommends a using a 10-ounce jar of Raffetto's Nesselro fruits, but advises
that if you cannot find that, you could subsitute a mix of candied fruit,
"tutti fruiti".

<p>
Is Nesselrode Pie perhaps the ancient ancestor of tutti frutti ice cream? More
information is clearly needed, but I have a developing theory: Nesselrode Pie
and related desserts were brought over to New England from Europe, where it
eventually morphed into frozen pudding ice cream. Independently, Roy Motherhead
invented tutti frutti ice cream, which ended up being similar in concept to
frozen pudding. (Pure speculation: perhaps Motherhead even independently based
tutti frutti ice cream on an experience with Nesselrode Pie?) Over the following
decades, frozen pudding ice cream and tutti frutti ice cream merged into one
largely indistinguishable flavor.

<p>
If any readers have further insight into the lineage of Nesselrode Pie, please
feel free to <a href="mailto:tjr@acm.org">send me an email</a>. My theory is
largely unsubstantiated at the moment, but it seems plausible. I need more
culinary anthropology data!

<p>
[Serendipitously, Nesselrode Pie was once featured on another television classic,
<a href="http://thatchbo.blogspot.com/2010/01/bee-taylors-nesselrode-pie.html">an
episode of the Andy Griffith Show</a>! This particular recipe seems to have lost
the bits of candied fruit, but nevertheless it is an unexpected and almost certainly
unintended dessert linkage between the two programs, and apparently the catalyst for
a brief quest for some viewers.]


<h2>Tutti Frutti Quotes</h2>
Here are a few quotes describing tutti frutti / frozen pudding:
<ul>
  <li>"Well, it's kind of hard to explain."
(<em>Ozzie Nelson, in the tutti frutti episode</em>)</li>
  <li>"We wonder about the origination of frozen pudding as we can't
figure out why anyone would enjoy this combination. A strangely
flavored ice cream base with bits of unidentifiable fruit. Didn't this
used to be called tutti-frutti?" 
(<em>from a review of Dean Dairy's ice cream products</em>)</li>

  <li>"...with peaches and pineapples, too, and cherries sprinkled through..."
(<em>from a song in the tutti frutti episode</em>)</li>

<h2>Edy's Spumoni?</h2>
<p>
One reader wrote in to inform me that the fruit-flavored layer of
<a href="http://edys.com/brand/funflavors/flavor.asp?b=1421&f=2858">Edy's Spumoni
ice cream</a> is in fact tutti frutti. If anyone else out there can confirm this,
I would be delighted to <a href="mailto:tjr@acm.org">hear from you</a>. Thanks!

<blockquote>As I've told you before, this place claims to have the
original Tutti Frutti ice
cream: <a href="http://www.leopoldsicecream.com/">www.leopoldsicecream.com</a>It's
about time someone put it on your web page so all those pursuing the
ice cream have a link to the self-proclaimed original.<br>

<blockquote>Tutti Fruiti has got to me one of the best flavors out
there. The biggest problem I have come up with is telling the
specialty ice cream shop exactly what it tastes like. I haven't tasted
it since 1983,I would remember it if I had some but try telling one of
the young kids in the ice cream shop about it! Thanks so much for the
link above...I will definetly contact them at once. Thank
you!<br><em>Posted by Firefly Lover</em></blockquote>

<blockquote>We used to be able to get tutti frutti ice cream at Dipper
Dan's, when I was a kid (about 30+ years ago). As best as I can
recall, it was basically vanilla ice cream with bits of candied fruit
in it (not unlike the candied fruit used in most fruit cakes). That
seems to be confirmed by most of the searches I've done. Have you
tried making your own? There are lots of recipes on the net. But you
could probably just go simple by making vanilla and tossing some
chopped bits of the glace fruit and nuts in while it churns.<br><em>Posted

<blockquote>I can relate to the person that wanted Tutti Fruiti Ice
Cream after watching the Adventures of Ozzie &amp; Harriet. After
watching the Rob Zombie move, "The Devil's Rejects", I've been wanting
to try some Tutti Frutti. I've never heard of it before so I starting
asking around. Nobody can really tell me exactly what it is. That's
when I decided to Google it and came across this site. Sounds like
it's hard to find. Has anyone ever heard of "Blue Moon" Ice Cream?
It's such a pretty blue &amp; kids order it just for the color. I
haven't seen it out here in the West. The last time I saw "Blue Moon"
Ice Cream was in Michigan. I never tried it, but now wish that I
have. I think it's supposed to taste fruity.<br><em>Posted by
