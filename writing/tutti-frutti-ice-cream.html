    <h2>In Search of Tutti Frutti Ice Cream</h2>

<p>
In 1989, my family and I saw a rerun of an "Adventures of
Ozzie and Harriet" television episode in which Ozzie desperately searches for tutti frutti
ice cream.  Watching this made me want some tutti frutti as well, even though I had never
tasted it.  It soon became apparent that it would be even harder for me to find tutti frutti
ice cream than it was for Ozzie.
</p>

<p>
A local ice cream manufactured offered to make us some tutti frutti
ice cream, but they would have to make it custom just for us, and we
would need to buy five gallons of it.  We declined, but I have since
wondered if that was really the best move.
</p>

<p>
Nine years later, I discovered that tutti frutti seemed to be
a popular flavor in India, so I started looking for the ice cream
in Indian restaurants and grocery stores.  One Indian grocer said that they
used to carry it, but it hadn't been selling well, so, as of this
year, they no longer carried the flavor.  However, they would be happy
to special-order it for us, if we bought five gallons of it.  This
time we said yes.
</p>

<p>
It turned out that this ice cream was in fact labeled as "tooty
fruity", a mispelling which makes me wonder if it was authentic.  Perhaps
it was, but I continue my quest until I find and consume product that
both seems authentic based on my research and whose label is correctly
spelled.  In any event, the "tooty fruity" had a rather non-descript-flavored
ice cream base, with bits of candied fruit.  It seemed that most of the
overall flavor came from the bits of fruit rather than the ice cream itself,
and tasted not unlike a combination of orange "Dreamsicle" ice cream bars
and dried Turkish apricots.
</p>

<p>

Internet searches have shown that, for people in the United States,
the best option for finding tutti frutti may be to look in Massachusetts.
   Gary, of <a href="http://www.garysicecream.com/">Gary's Ice Cream</a> in
Chelmsford, states that a flavor called
"frozen pudding" (which is supposedly not uncommon in Massachusetts) is the same
as tutti frutti, only without nuts.  (Tutti frutti includes nuts, usually
walnuts, Gary says.)
</p>

<p>
During a trip to Boston in the fall of 2008, I continued my search. Toscanini's didn't have
it. <a href="http://www.brighams.com/flavors/default.asp?flavor=12">Brigham's website</a>
claims they make frozen pudding from September through December, but when I stopped
in at the Brigham's parlor near the <a href="http://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a> in Boston, the rather grim clerk at the counter said, "It's seasonal; we don't have any."
This was October.

<p>
I asked a native Boston tour guide about it. He said that some guy in his neighborhood makes it, but just closed up shop for the winter. I spent $40 in taxi fare going to grocery stores in search of it. Nothing. I tried several other ice cream parlors; only one person laughed at me. I did end up getting some tasty <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/trothwell/3192929286/">butter pecan ice cream</a> at a shop in Harvard Square, but it just wasn't what I was after. 
<p>
So my quest continues... 


<h3>Tutti Frutti Recipes</h3>

A web search for tutti frutti ice cream tends to result in lots
of recipes, the contents of which can vary wildly.  It's possible
that one of these recipes is authentic, but I have no way of
knowing.  Feel free to look through such recipes and give one a
try; authentic or not, you might find a new ice cream flavor

<h3>Tutti Frutti Quotes</h3>

"Well, it's kind of hard to explain."
<br>
(<i>Ozzie Nelson, in the tutti frutti episode</i>)
</li>

<br>

<li>
"We wonder about the origination of frozen pudding as we can't figure out
why anyone would enjoy this combination. A strangely flavored ice cream
base with bits of unidentifiable fruit. Didn't this used to be called
tutti-frutti?"

</li>

<br>

<h3>Comments from Readers</h3>

<blockquote>As I've told you before, this place claims to have the original Tutti Frutti ice cream: <a href="http://www.leopoldsicecream.com/">www.leopoldsicecream.com</a> It's about time someone put it on your web page so all those pursuing the ice cream have a link to the self-proclaimed original.<p><i>Posted by Lori Neirynck </i></p></blockquote><hr width=60%><blockquote>Tutti Fruiti has got to me one of the best flavors out there. The biggest problem I have come up with is telling the specialty ice cream shop exactly what it tastes like. I haven't tasted it since 1983,I would remember it if I had some but try telling one of the young kids in the ice cream shop about it! Thanks so much for the link above...I will definetly contact them at once. Thank you!<p><i>Posted by Firefly Lover</i></p></blockquote><hr width=60%><blockquote>We used to be able to get tutti frutti ice cream at Dipper Dan's, when I was a kid (about 30+ years ago). As best as I can recall, it was basically vanilla ice cream with bits of candied fruit in it (not unlike the candied fruit used in most fruit cakes). That seems to be confirmed by most of the searches I've done. Have you tried making your own? There are lots of recipes on the net. But you could probably just go simple by making vanilla and tossing some chopped bits of the glace fruit and nuts in while it churns.<p><i>Posted by Dougal Campbell</i></p></blockquote><hr width=60%><blockquote>I can relate to the person that wanted Tutti Fruiti Ice Cream after watching the Adventures of Ozzie & Harriet. After watching the Rob Zombie move, "The Devil's Rejects", I've been wanting to try some Tutti Frutti. I've never heard of it before so I starting asking around. Nobody can really tell me exactly what it is. That's when I decided to Google it and came across this site. Sounds like it's hard to find. Has anyone ever heard of "Blue Moon" Ice Cream? It's such a pretty blue & kids order it just for the color. I haven't seen it out here in the West. The last time I saw "Blue Moon" Ice Cream was in Michigan. I never tried it, but now wish that I have. I think it's supposed to taste fruity.<p><i>Posted by Jen</i></p></blockquote><hr width=60%><blockquote>I used to eat Tutti Frutti Ice Cream almost everyday growing up in England made by a company called Walls.

Now here in NY it is impossible to find and I still crave it after all this time.

If anyone has any information feel free to email me:

ssaunders@psimultimedia.com or redgrant@optonline.net<p><i>Posted by Steven</i></p></blockquote><hr width=60%><blockquote>I'm at sideways8@att.net

Last time I had Tutti Frutti was from Sedutto's Ice Cream located on Staten Island NYC and sold wherever Sedduto stands were in NYC about 25 years ago  It was oustanding and original. Remamber Chico Marx selling it out of his pushcart, In one of the Marx Bros. early 30s movies. I have been looking for for years.  Wish Sedutto's would make it again.  They don't now.

HELP!!!<p><i>Posted by Vic Pfaus</i></p></blockquote>
