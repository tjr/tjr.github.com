I started reading Philip Greenspun's database-backed web application
books and articles around 2005. While I had previously seen database
development as the droll, boring corner of computer science, as I
realized how useful it could be to route a database through a web
site, I became intrigued.

<p>
I shortly dove in and <a href="/software/cedar-rapids-online">tried
building some database-backed web sites of my own</a>, more or less
following along with
Philip's <a href="http://philip.greenspun.com/seia/">curriculum for
his semester-long class at MIT</a>. I was pleased with what I had
learned, but was aware that my self-taught understanding of the
database side of things was somewhat superficial.

<p>
In January 2012, I had opportunity to take a three-day (all-day)
intensive class at MIT, led by Philip, specifically focusing on
relational database systems.

<h2>Class Format</h2>

<p>
Perhaps one of the most novel aspects of the class was the overall
format. From what I've seen, most computer science classes consist
of an hour-long lecture in which students are more or less read
passages from a textbook, and then given homework assignments to
go off and do by themselves.

<p>
In this class, Philip gave a mini-lecture of a half-hour or so, then
gave the class a short programming exercise based on the lecture
material. We were all to bring our own laptop computers to class, and
(thanks to the power of <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/">Virtual
Box</a>, we were all running the exact same software configuration)
complete the assigned exercises right there in the classroom. Philip
along with a handful of teaching assistants were available to help,
and roamed about amongst the students asking us how were were doing if
we appeared to be stuck.

<p>
After a half-hour or so of letting us churn through the exercise,
we pasted our (attempts at?) solutions into a shared Google Docs
document, and Philip reviewed and discussed our solutions in front
of the class, followed by showing us his own solutions. Then he
moved on to the next topic, and the process started over. The pace
was fast, and reminded me of the time I spent on the
<a href="http://www.cornellcollege.edu/">Cornell College</a> block
schedule, only moreso.

<p>
How did this approach work? I think very well. Nearly all of the
material we covered in the class was taken either directly or
indirectly from Philip's <a href="http://philip.greenspun.com/sql/">online
SQL book</a>, which I had perused many times while working on my own
database projects. But even though I had access to this knowledge, my
depth and breadth of study was limited to what I thought I needed to
know in order to solve my immediate problem. Being "forced" to work
through <i>all</i> of the material in class, even if it appeared too
boring or too challenging from a distance, prompted me to learn things
that I had never bothered to learn before.

<h2>Web Clients vs. Native Applications</h2>

<p>
While the class focused on databases, we also took some brief
excursions into making end user-facing applications that connect with
the databases, both a small web application and a small Android mobile
phone application.

<p>
What did we learn? It's much easier to make web applications, and
much more cumbersome to make native applications, that do more or less
the same thing. Philip wisely pointed out that the web applications he
built nineteen years ago still work fine, while he doubts that any
mobile phone applications built today will still be usable nineteen
years from now.

<p>
Which makes more sense to work on?

<h2>But Are Relational Database Systems Still Useful?</h2>
<p>
On Tuesday afternoon, database expert
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Stonebraker">Michael
Stonebraker</a> gave a fascinating guest lecture in which he proposed
that the standard big-name database systems like Oracle and MySQL
might not really be what you want to use.

<p>
Modern database usage can be divided into three general areas: online
transaction processing, data warehousing, and a variety of other
specialized niche uses.  Online transaction processing demands high
availabilty and fast performance on short, simple queries. Data
warehousing demands huge amounts of storage space and running complex
queries. Quantitative analysis (such as that done on stock market
numbers) demands access to data more like a two-dimensional array
than rows of columns in a traditional database.

<p>
Systems like Oracle and MySQL can be used to model the data in all of
these situations, but they aren't optimized for any of them. Instead,
if your application needs more than Oracle can muster, it is better to
use specialized database systems: <a href="http://voltdb.com/">VoltDB</a>
is optimized for online transaction processing, and works as much as
75x faster than Oracle. <a href="http://www.vertica.com/">Vertica</a>
provides a 25x performance boost over Oracle for data warehousing
applications. For array-based processing,
<a href="http://www.scidb.org/">SciDB</a> offers superior performance.

<p>
So is Oracle just a worthless piece of junk? Not exactly. There are
plenty of applications that do not require a high-performance database.
If you don't need high performance, then Oracle might be a fine choice.
An even better choice would be an open-source database system like
<a href="http://www.actian.com/products/ingres">Ingres</a> or
<a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>, since they offer
features comparable to Oracle without the hefty licensing fees.

<h2>Additional Topics</h2>

<p>
After the final class session, several of us stuck around to chat
with Philip and hear his views on sundry other topics, such as
startup companies.

<p>
Many young programmers today aspire to launch a successful startup
company. Of course, many more startups fail in oblivion than strike
it rich, but the allure is strong. The recent trend has been to try
to acquire some sort of funding and go to work on your startup
full-time.

<p>
Philip asked, why would you want to work at a poorly-funded startup,
working potentially very long hours and always wondering when the horizon
of money is going to run out? Wouldn't it be
better to get a job at a well-funded company and work on your product
idea in your free time? If your project takes off, then wonderful,
but if not, you haven't put yourself at financial risk.

<p>
I'm sure there are pros and cons to both approaches, but for people
with families and other responsibilities, maintaining relatively
secure income may be the better way to go.

<p>
What about deciding which technologies to learn? All other things being
equal, it may be better to develop experience on expensive proprietary
technology than on freely-available technology: if a company has the
money to pay for the proprietary technology, then (ostensibly) they also
have the money to pay you well. Many proprietary software vendors offer
free demos; download the demo, build something with the software, and
add your newly-acquired skill to your resume.

<p>
But even more important than having a laundry list of technologies on
your resume is being able to list projects completed. Being able to point
to a software product (or a distinct sub-component of one) and say "I built
that" is a strong indicator of engineering ability.

<h2>Outside of the Class</h2>
<p>
It seems that different parts of the world are somehow more conducive
to certain fields of endeavor than other parts of the world.  If
you're into science and engineering, the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology is simply an awesome environment to be in. As I roamed the
corridors, hung out in the student center, and bought tea in the lobby
caf&eacute;, it was as if innovative technological ideas were just
floating around in the atmosphere, available to grab and make your
own.

<h2>Bonus Points: An MIT Hack</h2>
<p>
MIT students are well-known for
<a href="http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/misc/best_of.html">performing
hacks on campus</a>, and we had opportunity to witness a small one
during the class:

</center>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>
The knowledge I gained in the class was sitting right before me in
book form for years. Probably had I only read <i>all</i> of the
material, and made a solid effort to work through <i>all</i> of the
examples, I would have been much further ahead earlier on. This surely
holds true for other areas as well: if a good educator has taken the
time to write a good book on a topic that you wish to learn more
about, then <i>read the book</i>.

<p>
That said, the class was an awesome experience. The interactive nature
lets you learn more easily than through reading alone, and the class
structure helps you to stay focused and get through the material.

<p>
Not only did I learn more details about database systems, but I feel
professionally recharged, and eager to continue on in my career as a
software engineer.
