I started reading Philip Greenspun's database-backed web application
books and articles around 2005. While I had previously seen database
development as the droll, boring corner of computer science, when I
realized how useful it could be to route a database through a web
site, I became intrigued.

<p>
I shortly dove in and <a href="/software/cedar-rapids-online">tried
building some database-backed web sites of my own</a>, more or less
following along with
Philip's <a href="http://philip.greenspun.com/seia/">curriculum for
his class at MIT</a>. I was pleased with what I had learned, but was
aware that my self-taught understanding of the database side of things
was somewhat superficial.

<p>
In January 2012, I had opportunity to take a three-day (all-day)
intensive class at MIT, led by Philip, specifically focusing on
relational database systems.

<h2>Class Format</h2>

<p>
Perhaps one of the most novel aspects of the class was the overall
format. From what I've seen, most computer science classes consist
of an hour-long lecture in which students are more or less read
passages from a textbook, and then given homework assignments to
go off and do by themselves.

<p>
In this class, Philip gave a mini-lecture of a half-hour or so, then
gave the class a short programming exercise based on the lecture
material. We were all to bring our own laptop computers to class, and
(thanks to the power of <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/">Virtual
Box</a>, we were all running the exact same software configuration)
complete the assigned exercises right there in the classroom. Philip
along with a handful of teaching assistants were available to help,
and roamed about amongst the students asking us how were were doing if
we appeared to be stuck.

<p>
After a half-hour or so of letting us churn through the exercise,
we pasted our (attempts at?) solutions into a shared Google Docs
document, and Philip reviewed and discussed our solutions in front
of the class, followed by showing us his own solutions. Then he
moved on to the next topic, and the process started over.

<p>
How did this approach work? I think very well. Nearly all of the
material we covered in the class was taken either directly or
indirectly from Philip's <a href="http://philip.greenspun.com/sql/">online
SQL book</a>, which I had perused many times while working on my own
database projects. But even though I had access to this knowledge, my
depth and breadth of study was limited to what I thought I needed to
know in order to solve my immediate problem. Being "forced" to work
through <i>all</i> of the material in class, even if it appeared too
boring or too challenging from a distance, prompted me to learn things
that I had never bothered to learn before.

<h2>Are Relational Database Systems Still Useful?</h2>
<p>
On Tuesday afternoon, database expert
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Stonebraker">Michael
Stonebraker</a> gave a fascinating guest lecture in which he proposed
that the standard big-name database systems like Oracle and MySQL
might not really be what you want to use.

<p>
Modern database usage can be divided into three general areas: online
transaction processing, data warehousing, and a variety of other
specialized niche uses.  Online transaction processing demands high
availabilty and fast performance. Data warehousing demands huge
amounts of storage space.

<h2>Additional Topics</h2>
<p>
After the final class session, several of us stuck around to chat
with Philip and hear his views on sundry other topics, such as
startup companies.

<p>
Many young programmers today aspire to launch a successful startup
company. Of course, many more startups fail in oblivion than strike
it rich, but the allure is strong. The recent trend has been to try
to acquire some sort of funding and go to work on your startup
full-time.

<p>
Philip asked, why would you want to work at a poorly-funded startup,
always wondering how much longer money will last? Wouldn't it be
better to get a job at a well-funded company and work on your product
idea in your free time? If your project takes off, then wonderful,
but if not, you haven't put yourself at financial risk.

<p>
I'm sure there are pros and cons to both approaches, but for folks
with families and other responsibilities, maintaining relatively
secure income may be the better way to go.

<h2>Outside of the Class</h2>
<p>
It seems that different parts of the world are somehow more conducive
to certain fields of endeavor than other parts of the world.
If you're into science and engineering, the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology is simply an awesome environment to be in. As I roamed the
corridors, hung out in the student center, and bought tea in the lobby
caf√©, it was as if innovative technological ideas were just floating
around in the atmosphere, available to grab and make your own.

<h2>Bonus Points: An MIT Hack</h2>
<p>
MIT students are well-known for

one during the class:

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>
I enjoy learning. I enjoy reading. I enjoy academics. I'm kind of confused as to
why I never forced myself to sit down and study all of the database topics and
techniques that we covered in this class on my own. I'm sure there are other people
who could get by just fine without the formal class structure. All I can suppose is
that different people learn differently, and while there is plenty I have learned
on my own, sometimes the formal classroom structure can help.

<p>
That said, the knowledge I gained in the class was sitting right before me in
book form for years. Probably had I only read <i>all</i> of the material, and
made a solid effort to complete <i>all</i> of the associated exercises, I would
have been much further ahead earlier on. This surely holds true for other areas
as well: if a good educator has taken the time to write a good book on a topic
that you wish to learn more about, then <i>read the book</i>. Sure, take the class
as well if you like, but squeeze every last drop of knowledge out of the book
that you can.
