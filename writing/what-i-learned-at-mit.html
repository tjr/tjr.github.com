<h1>What I Learned at MIT</h1>
<p>by <a href="/">Trevis Rothwell</a>, February 2012</p>

<hr>

<h2>
I started reading Philip Greenspun's database-backed web application
books and articles around 2005. While I had previously seen database
development as the droll, boring corner of computer science, when I
realized how useful it could be to route a database through a web
site, I became intrigued.

<h2>Are Relational Database Systems Still Useful?</h2>
<p>
On Tuesday afternoon, database expert
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Stonebraker">Michael
Stonebraker</a> gave a fascinating guest lecture in which he proposed
that the standard big-name database systems like Oracle and MySQL
might not really be what you want to use.

<p>
Modern database usage can be divided into three general areas: online
transaction processing, data warehousing, and a variety of other
specialized niche uses.  Online transaction processing demands high
availabilty and fast performance. Data warehousing demands huge
amounts of storage space.

<h2>Additional Topics</h2>
<p>
After the final class session, several of us stuck around to chat
with Philip and hear his views on sundry other topics, such as
startup companies.

<p>
Many young programmers today aspire to launch a successful startup
company. Of course, many more startups fail in oblivion than strike
it rich, but the allure is strong. The recent trend has been to try
to acquire some sort of funding and go to work on your startup
full-time.

<p>
Philip asked, why would you want to work at a poorly-funded startup,
always wondering how much longer money will last? Wouldn't it be
better to get a job at a well-funded company and work on your product
idea in your free time? If your project takes off, then wonderful,
but if not, you haven't put yourself at financial risk.

<p>
I'm sure there are pros and cons to both approaches, but for folks
with families and other responsibilities, maintaining relatively
secure income may be the better way to go.

<h2>Bonus Points: An MIT Hack</h2>

one during the class:
